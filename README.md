# Curiosity432 hugo-PaperMod


## Theme installation
This blog is using [hugo-PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) read the Wiki for more information [hugo-PaperMod - Installation](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/wiki/Installation).


## Process to publish the blog
> This method is using JAMstack (Javascript API Markup stack) to create the frontend, without on a server without backend

1. Write the content with an editor (neovim, vscode) or PKM (Obsidian.md, Logseq).

2. Use a Static Site Generator like HUGO to translate markdown (measy markupo language) to the "universal" web format (HTML, CSS, JS)

3. Use a web hosting to serve and deploy your content
    - Hosting: GitHub to store the content
    - Deploying/serving:
      - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for free hosting of static websites.
      - [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/): frontend pages running on a server by GitHub
        a. upload content of`public/` website generated by HUGO to main branch in GitHub repo, then select GitHub Pages branch `/ (root)` or `/docs` to autobuild depending on your structure. You can also push to a separate branch like `gh-pages`.
        b. define GitHub workflow `.github/workflows/hugo.yaml`and select GitHub Workflow to autobuild and serve. This method requires more knowledge to intall a linux server, configure node.js and deploy.

> It is necessary to ensure that the repo has the content in the `/ (root)` or `/docs` for autobuild with GitHub Pages.

> If you are creating a web page with HTML, CSS and JS you can deploy directly to main branch and selet GitHub Pages branch `/ (root)` to autobuild and serve.

under root (`/`) with basic HTML, CSS, JS

### My exact method
Write the content with VSCode upload to GitHub with Git under https://github.com/curiosity432/curiosity432.github.io then autobuild and serve to https://curiosity432.github.io/ with GitHub workflows. And finally autosync with Netlify https://curiosity432.xyz/ from GitHub.

### Pros and Cons
- Pros:
  -Templates created by others and modify it.
  - Write content in markdown which is simpler than HTML and CSS, and it is compatible with a lot of PKM systems.
  - Update the content just with git features.
  - Have all your web in a static page without a database.

- Cons:
  - You need to configure and install dependencies on each CMS framework that converts markup to web languages.
  - Each framework works different and has different syntax.
    - Jekyll needs to install ruby and install dependencies.
    - HUGO needs to create the template, then you need to work with a specific folder structure.
