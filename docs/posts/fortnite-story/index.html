Considered by Epic as a cross between Minecraft and Left 4 Dead, in Fortnite up to four players cooperate in various missions on different maps to collect resources, build fortifications around defensive objectives that should help fight the storm and protect survivors, and build weapons and traps to engage in combat with waves of these creatures intent on destroying the objectives.
