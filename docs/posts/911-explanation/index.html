This event brought with it the increase of security measures in the fight against terrorism and the consequent wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East.\nThe most shocking news and with more repercussion in the media was the collapse of the twin towers (WTC1 and WTC2) due to the crash of two airplanes hijacked by the terrorist group al-Qaeda, in the televisions were distributed videos where a plane hit one of the twin towers and later other videos taken from another angle. However, without going off the record, it is not widely known that more buildings were affected that same day in the same area including WTC 3 and seven hours later the total collapse of WTC 7.\nAs time went by, groups and movements arose to know the truth about the 9/11 attacks, the subject became a conspiracy topic and many people began to doubt the official version distributed by the media, but it is not necessary to conspire to doubt the facts because reviewing the official documentation there are flaws and inconsistencies that make you rethink the facts. In Wikipedia itself, the “Discussion” and English section is full of debate with ideas that differ from the official version.\nThis article tries to summarize the official version of the facts and argue a more realistic alternative point of view to understand the When, Where, What, What, How, Who and Why or When, Where, What, How, Who and Why. These facts represent a very strong drama for the society, that’s why I do it with all my respect for the victims and their relatives.\nOfficial version As of today in 2022, the major sources for information about the official version of the 9/11 attacks are Wikipedia (online encyclopedia) with detailed articles with hundreds of quotes and Archive.org (California online library) with a database of video recordings. In 2001, cell phones barely existed and did not have video cameras, but the media and some people recorded the fires and the cause of the explosions in the towers.\nThe official investigations of the events of September 11, established that the 9/11 attacks were of an Islamic terrosite nature with the hijacking of planes that ended up crashing into the U.S. world economic headquarters in New York (WTC), the headquarters of the Department of Defense (the Pentagon) and another plane bound for the Capitol (Washington DC) that managed to evade the hijackers and ended up losing control crashing in an open field in Shakesville.\nOfficial event On Tuesday, September 11, 2001 between 8:46 - 10:28 a series of attacks took place which became known as 9/11 or 9/11. On that day the DoD (Department of Defense) had planned a series of military exercises to simulate an air raid on New York.\nThe sites affected by the attack were:\nWTC (World Trace Center) in Manhattan, New York. The Pentagon (DoD (Department of Defense) Center) located in Arlington, Virginia, suffered structural damage to the West ring of the building. United Airlines plane 93, crashes in the Shanksville, Pennsylvania wasteland. The three sites affected during 9/11 are located in the eastern United States. Arlington (Virginia) and Washington D.C. are very close to each other at 9 km distance separated by the Potomac River, while New York is north of them at 370 km distance.\nPlaces affected (context) Pentagon The Pentagon is the logistics center of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), built between September 11, 1941 and January 15, 1943. It is home to the FBI and CIA.\nWTC The World Trade Center (WTC) was the most important economic center in the world at the time, located in Manhattan (New York, United States). The financial complex was composed of:\nTwin Towers: tallest skyscrapers in the world until their collapse on 9/11. WTC 1 (north tower) with 110 floors and 410 meters high. A 110-meter-tall telecommunications antenna was added in 1978. WTC 2 (south tower) with 110 floors and 410 meters high. WTC 3 or Marriott World Trade Center. A 22-story hotel with 825 rooms, it connected the North Tower (WTC 1) with the South Tower (WTC 2). WTC 4 WTC 5 WTC 6 WTC 7 The complex had suffered three attacks in the course of history, before the total collapse. On a typical day, 50,000 people were working with more than 430 companies involved. Construction (1965 - 1973) Builder: Minoru Yamasaki, Emery Roth \u0026 Sons Financed by the Rockefeller family, similar in style to the Rockefeller Center buildings in midtown Manhattan spaced just 6 km apart in a straight line. The grandson of Standard Oil founder John D. Rockefeller, David Rockefeller decided to revive the WTC concept as the core of revitalized lower Manhattan. In May 1959, Rockefeller formed the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association, invested $250 million near the Fish Market on the East River, including a single tower with 70 stores and several smaller buildings. Reconstruction (2001 - 2013) 2. Rebuild: Larry Silverstein (Silverstein Properties), Daniel Libeskind (both Jewish). New complex includes: One World Trade Center, a high-rise building being planned at World Trade Center 2, World Trade Center 3, World Trade Center 4, World Trade Center 7, and another office building. Private actions Between 1998 - 2001 the WTC was privatized. A few months before the event, the lease of the World Trade Center was sold to Larry Silverstein along with GMAC Commercial Mortgage (a subsidiary of General Motors), Westfield America Inc and real estate investor Lloyd Goldman. Silverstein took out insurance that “fortuitously” covered terrorism. After 9/11, Silverstein took the insurance company to court, claiming they should pay him double because there were two attacks. He won and was awarded $4,550,000,000.

Bank of tons of karat gold in the basement of the WTC). Public events Chess Championship in 1995 - The final was played on the 107th floor of the South Tower (WTC 2). Game 11 was the decisive point in the chess match, Gasparov vs. Anand, which Gasparov won. In 1983 Dan Goodwin a.k.a. SpiderDan, the SkyscraperMan, climbed the North Tower before its fall. Philippe Petit crosses the WTC 1 and WTC towers by means of a thin cable while balancing. Previous attacks 13 February 1975, fire of 3 alarms on the 11th floor, spread by telephone cable to 5 more floors (2 below and 3 above). 26 February 1993, bomb attack (680 kg of explosives, Pakistani terrorsite). January 14, 1998, bank robbery (1.6 million, Brink’s armored truck to deliver the money by elevator to the 11th floor of WTC 1. How did it happen? Terrosite attack with airplanes According to the official version, 19 terrorists from the al-Qaeda terrorist group (in 4 distributed groups) hijack 4 commercial airliners and crash them with the aim of causing major structural and human damage to prominent U.S. buildings.\nAmerican Airlines Flight 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_11) a Boeing 767 departs Boston (Logan International Airport) for Los Angeles International Airport, but crashes into WTC 1 (north tower). United Airlines Flight 175](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_175) a Boeing 767 departs Boston (Logan International Airport) for Los Angeles International Airport, but crashes into WTC 2 (south tower). American Airlines Flight 77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_77) a Boeing 757 departs Washington Dulles International Airport (Virginia) and crashes into the West Wing of the Pentagon. United Airlines Flight 93](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93) a Boeing 757 departs Newark International Airport (New Jersey) for San Francisco (California). It was supposedly intended to be crashed into the Capitol but the crew managed to reduce the assailants and the plane ended up crashing in an open field in Stonycreek, Pennsylvania. Route of the planes according to the official version.\nFacts in chronological order At 08:46:40 American Airlines 11 crashes into the north facade of WTC 1 causing an explosion between the 93rd and 99th floors. After 102 min, at 10:28 it collapses. At 09:02:54 United Airlines Flight 175 crashes into the south facade of WTC 2 causing an explosion between the 77th and 85th floors. After 56 minutes, at 09:59 it collapses. At 09:37 American Airlines 77 crashes into the West side of the Pentagon. At 10:03 United Airlines Flight 93 crashes in Stonycreek Township, Pennsylvania. At 10:30 George Bush issues a statement of terrorist attack caused by airplanes. At 17:21 WTC 7 collapses in its entirety in 1 minute, 6 hours and 54 minutes after the second building collapse, WTC 1. FEMA version\nThe alleged crash of the plane into the Pentagon according to the official version.\nData WTC 1, WTC 2, WTC 3 (Marriott WTC) and WTC 7 collapse completely, the remaining three buildings (WTC 4, WTC 5, WTC 6) were damaged and subsequently demolished. The Deutsche Bank building closes after 9/11 due to radioactive contamination of the site, during the following months high radiation levels are recorded. NIST estimated about 17,400 people were in the WTC that day, yet only 2,753 deaths were certified. The attacks caused 2,977 fatalities, more than 25,000 injuries and considerable long-term health consequences, in addition to at least $10 billion in infrastructure and property damage. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, suspicion quickly fell on Al Qaeda and its leader Bin Laden. The United States formally responded by launching the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, who had not complied with U.S. demands to expel Al Qaeda from Afghanistan and extradite their leader Bin Laden. Officially the attacks were organized by the Islamic terrorist gang Al-Qaeda, which was in charge of hijacking the planes and crashing them. Their alleged motives were due to: U.S. support for Israel Support for “anti-Muslim attacks” in Somalia Support for the Philippines against Muslims in the Moro conflict Support for Israeli “aggression” against Muslims in Lebanon Support for Russia’s “atrocities against Muslims” in Chechnya Support for pro-U.S. governments in the Middle East (who “act as their agents”) against Muslim interests Support for India’s “oppression against Muslims” in Kashmir The presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia Sanctions against Iraq Alternative version Inconsistencies In the official version there are many incongruities and coincidences that raise doubts.\nOn September 10, 11 and 12, 2001 the Department of Defense (DoD) had planned a series of military exercises over New York City simulating an air raid, a situation that caused great confusion at the actual time of the attack. The previous days New York City suffered a 36-hour power outage. In addition, all WTC personnel along with the CIA, nSA and FBI were relocated to other offices. The version of the plane crash at WTC does not fit: The Empire State had suffered in 1945 the impact of a B-25 bomber plane and did not collapse. Sabotaging the cockpit of an airplane, with only the contents of the cockpit, is complicated due to the security doors. The F16 stealth planes did not go to intercept the hijacked airliners despite deviating from the route. Donald Rumsfeld, DoD Secretary, denied the takeoff order. If the planes had been hijacked from the beginning why did they make a detour to attack the towers and did not go directly. To hit two planes at low altitude at that speed is very complicated. There were no remains of the black boxes of the planes, nor the fuselage of these. There are videos that show explosions on the floors without plane crashes and there are people who affirm it. The videos that show a plane crash show that the plane goes through the building and then breaks the structure. And in the alleged photographs the plane is completely black with no shades of light. No passengers were identified from the plane nor any remains of them, however the IDs of the eight terrorists were found in good condition allowing them to be identified. A newscast tells the news of the fall of WTC 7 before its collapse with live images of the building standing. Shortly after, there is a cut in the transmission, with loss of the green image typical of explosions. WTC 7 collapsed 7 hours later and did not suffer any collision of artifacts. According to the official version, it collapsed due to fires in the base. No building in history has ever collapsed due to fire risk, let alone in 6 seconds. Frank A. DeMartini, manager of the construction of the WTC, assured in a documentary of the “History” channel recorded in January 2001 that: “The towers were structurally designed for the collision of 707 airplanes, the largest at that time”. The fall of the towers WTC1 and WTC2, is completely vertical starting from the base, if it were due to the weight of the airplanes they would fall from top to bottom and it was not the case. The firemen who were helping heard a loud noise before the collapse of the building. Buildings that have been shot at by missiles break into pieces and fall in the direction of the missile. The size caused in the explosions of the building does not correspond to that of the airplanes, since it has greater amplitude and does not present the form of the airplanes. The crash of a plane into the Pentagon does not fit either: The size of the gap generated by the impacted object does not correspond to the shape of an airplane. An airplane can’t fly at ground level that fast. The intermediate frames of the video of the object hitting the Pentagon were deleted. Senior personnel did not show up for work that day, including senior managers. The NSA, FBI and CIA were given the day off. Far fewer people than expected came to work at the WTC offices despite it being a Tuesday. Money at stake: 300 billion dollars worth of gold, silver and other precious metals were removed from underneath the WTC basement. Several entities and groups took advantage of the fall in the stock market to gain multi-million dollar shares. The Silversteins insured WTC1 and WTC2 for risk of terrorist attack months before the event, and took the insurer to court because they only contemplated one attack and not one for each tower, won the trial and doubled their value to $4.55 billion. Witnesses: Witnessed bombs exploding in the buildings. 2. 2. Firefighters heard the sound of an explosion before the buildings collapsed. Independent investigations and testimonies: The former president stated that it could only have been provoked by the explosion of bombs. 2. Jet fuel (kerosene) can at best burn at 1700ºF and 2950ºF as in the towers, many scientists claim that military explosive could have been used to melt the steel bases. Among them, Physicist Steven Jones claims that the WTC7 building and the Twin Towers were brought down not only by fire and damage resulting from the impact, but by cutting explosives installed in advance at the base of the buildings. He considered official reports from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the 9/11 Commission that the fires coupled with impact damage alone caused the complete toppling of the three buildings. And I present evidence for the controlled demolition hypothesis, suggested by the available data, which can be tested. Morgan Reynolds, a former advisor and economic advisor to the George W. Bush administration during his first term (now professor emeritus of economics at Texas A\u0026M University), declared that the government’s story is “bogus” and that the incident was artificially created. In a June 13, 2005 article in the Washington Times, Reynolds said, “It is impossible to deny the existence of the scientific debate surrounding the real causes of the collapse of the Twin Towers and Tower 7. Only a professional, controlled demolition can explain all the elements proven in the investigation into the collapse of the three buildings.” No plane crashed in the Pentagon, but a missile exploded, this was supported by a statement made by Donald Rumsfeld himself in an interview to a press media, something that it was thought he would never admit. The attacks served as an excuse for: The fight against terrorism and the increase of security measures at all levels. The war against Afghanistan, the war against the Middle East and the search and capture of Osama Bin Laden (member of al-Qaeda). Gaining control of oil in the Middle East. Justification for attacking Afghanistan, creating wars, imposing new measures and changing the world economy. The 9/11 documentaries and films reinforce the idea of revenge, fight terrorism by focusing on hatred towards Islamic terrorists.\tAnd invest more in armaments and in the military sector. The plane enters without breaking the structure and then you see the explosion. Moreover, depending on the video it looks more realistic or more fake, and even in some of them you can only see the explosion without the impact of the plane. Your browser does not support the video tag. Compilation of videos of the crash of United Airlines Flight 175 into the south facade of WTC 2.\nIt is very likely that they edited the video and distributed it. For comparison in the Hollywood movie “Troy” (2003) the scene where Achilles stabs Boagrius in the neck with a dagger looks much more realistic. Your browser does not support the video tag. Clip Achilles vs Boagrius, Troy All these incongruities and coincidences show that the official version is false, it contains true elements but has several falsified facts to hide the real perpetrators and to point out an enemy to take advantage of.\nAnother important point is that from the first moment there was an impetus and way of acting on the part of the press and politics focused on revenge and capture of the attackers, instead of avoiding confrontation and trying to seek peace and restore order. It was already practicing it before with media programming (movies, series, news). The motives of the al-Qaeda group do not really carry much weight if compared to a premeditated attack by groups and lodges that made a great profit from it. These groups in turn would be hidden in the shadows and as long as there was no suspicion no one would be able to expose them.\nWhat really happened? The place and the sites affected are real, what is not certain is how it happened and who was behind it.\nThe towers did not collapse perfectly vertically by the collision of two planes, it is impossible that one plane brought down the structure of WTC 1 and then another WTC 2. “The steel structure of the towers was designed for the collision of Boeing 707 planes (the largest at the time)” said by the tenants themselves, physical simulations go against a possible structural collapse by the collision of planes. Now, if it is true that there were explosions, they were most likely installed bombs or devices dropped from outside, one article points to shots from the Woolworth building, while at the base controlled explosives were used, with nano-thermite bombs that melted and cut the steel columns in seconds.\nThe plane crash I rule out for several reasons:\nmany witnesses saw the explosion and saw no aircraft impact. The videos shown are not proof of it, as they look quite fake, they can be manipulated and there are other videos recorded of the same explosion where there is no plane impacting. There are no airplane fuselage remains in the WTC, there are no remains of the black boxes. The routes traveled by the planes having been hijacked from the beginning is to turn backwards, which does not make sense since it takes much longer. Maybe that point was to make landings and then follow the route in some way. Regarding the Pentagon attack it was not a plane either, this one simpler to understand. Here there is only one video available, which deleted the intermediate frames where the object was seen moving. Again there is no debris from the plane and the gap generated does not fit with a Boeing 757. It was a missile, this was acknowledged by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in a press question and Army Commander Albert Stubblebine said it was a missile and the explosions of the twin towers by controlled explosives.\nNow what happened to the four passenger planes that were allegedly hijacked and died crashing is more complex. There are several hypotheses here:\nThe planes take the normal route and landed earlier at a point where: their identification is changed or they are destroyed. Then a false signal is sent from the plane or else the radar is manipulated to the point of the attack. Passengers: They are either pre-selected to change their lives or are eliminated. The “terrorists” in charge of hijacking the plane were paid actors who would later remain alive. The plane crash in Pennsylvania, it is more difficult to know if it actually crashed or not. The people in the area did not hear any impact and it was not corroborated hours later. That plane was supposedly a terrorist attack on the Capitol in Washington D.C., the perfect cover for thinking that no high-ranking U.S. politicians could have been involved because it would have affected them.\nWho was behind it? The best way to sneak around and hide as the perpetrator is to blame others so you don’t get caught. Knowing that the official version makes no sense because of all the physical and logical inconsistencies, it shows that who is behind the support of these investigations are those who want to hide the information. The real perpetrators were the deep state, powerful families, high political officials, sectors of the NSA, the CIA, the FBI, Masonic lodges (specifically Judeo-Masons) and Zionists. The security agencies of several countries were also involved, including England (MI6), Israel (Mossad) and Saudi Arabia. The point is that it was organized in advance from the top.\nThe 9/11 attacks were a false flag attack (inside job) with multiple targets. Bin Laden and AlQaeda were actors who even had relationships with American politicians like the Clintons, Obama, Bush, there are pictures of friendship in the past. It was an attack organized from the Deep State, they had it planned from the date of its creation.\nThe fact that it was organized for a long time, even planned since its construction we can see it in the predictive programming of the media used as a negative primate to slow down the learning process in the audience and condition it.\nWhy did they do it? The why of the events is the hardest question and the one that has the most value. Why would anyone do harm to others even to their own people, for what purpose. A group of terrorists with box cutters and aircraft piloting skills is not capable of making a seamless attack let alone with the motives mentioned, as it was suicide.\nBy means of a false flag attack, the shadowy perpetrators can justify any recrimination:\nIt allows to change the world economy and politics. It allows to invest much more money in the military sector to fight “terrorism” and justify wars like the one in the Middle East. It allows invading territories and stealing oil in the countries causing “terrorism”. It allows to subdue the population through fear to make it more moldable and controllable. It allows to channel the energy of general thought to focus it on an idea. Allows for greater power and control. False flag attacks The United States is already known for its false flag attacks, throughout history it has used it several times as a pretext and justification for wars or a specific purpose.\nExplosion of the battleship Maine (own ship) by the United States to declare war on Spain and invade Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Attack of Pearl Harbor, the ships were not notified of a Japanese invasion. With this pretext they could drop bombs on the civilian population of Japan and thus demand its surrender. Sinking of the Titanic, several families were on board the ship to vote on the creation of the Federal Reserve, those who were in favor of its creation never set sail while the families who opposed it died at sea. This allowed the creation of the Federal Reserve by majority vote, which was used years later to finance both sides of World War I and World War II. In addition to money laundering and control. They seek war because they seek the desire to control, to conquer, to impose and thus gain more power. The objective is an energetic control is to channel the emanated energy and nourish themselves with it. If there is no one to invade, they would not be so interested in invading.\nAnd those in charge of this role are a series of groups and lodges that seek that power and that in part they have it because of the way the system has been structured.\nThe groups that intervened are difficult to know with totality but one can count Freemasonry (in particular by Jews), the agencies of the American government (NSA, CIA, FBI) and the MOSSAB (Isreal’s agency), the Rockefeller family, the Bush family and the Silversteins and high positions of Washington’s politics.\nWithin the State bodies many would not support such a cause but like any pyramid system, the lower ranks need not know.\nProgramming Before the attack dozens of artists made warnings of an attack on September 1, 2001 at the WTC, either on albums like (Michael Jackson), in a live concert like Prince (Osam Bin Laden getting ready to bomb 2001. Let’s go!), a writer warned that Bin Laden would be blamed months before the attacks, the singer of Oasis and much more that I have not mentioned.\nAnd hundreds of media, including comics, series, movies, cartoons, showed the fall of the towers and the plane bombing long before September 11, 2001, as a method of programming.\nSoon skyscraper on fire.\nA strip on a bridge in “Terminator” reads danger 9-11.\nA Marvel comic book features the twin towers cut with the Nazi flag.\nThe card of Neo protagonist of the Matrix, expires on September 11, 2001.\nThe Simpsons put on a magazine cover that reads New York 9 11 (eleven formed by the twin towers) and the money symbol (dollar). The magazine costs $9 dollars but the towers are purposely placed forming an 11.\nMichael Jackson’s cover explains the whole 9-11 bombing in New York. Michael marks 9:11 on an imaginary clock, he dances on top of a black and white checkered floor (of Freemasonry), in the background there is an explosion and WTC 1 is gone. She is dressed in blood red and there is a crescent moon as on September 1, 2001, referring to the sacrifice. He also wears a mourning on his right arm raised.\nHere I leave video compilation of predictive programs in the media, about 140 appearances refer to the twin towers and the pentagon with 9-11 being demolished with gunfire, bombs, planes, narratives of why they did it and with direct references to Freemasonry. After the attacks, much of the information containing references to 9/11 was removed because it was sensitive to the victims. In addition, censorship was applied to anyone who tried to seriously expose the facts and anyone who disagreed with the official version was ridiculed.\nSymbology When you study symbology you realize the power of numerology, astrology and the value these occult lodges place on it to perform their acts.\nFreemasonry The $5, $10, $20, $20, $50 and $100 bill folded just forms a building that goes from being on fire to being completely demolished, like WTC1 and WTC2. The creation of the dollar and banknotes has a lot to do with the creation of the United States and Freemasonry. The one dollar bill (the unit), features George Washington a prominent Freemason known as the founder of the United States and on its reverse side appears the Illiminati triangle and more encrypted symbology.\nThe arch of Washington Square gave a glimpse of the twin towers in the background. The cities are built in a grid pattern and many of them have a lot of Masonic symbolism with relationships of distances, shapes and geometries between important buildings. Washington, capital of the United States and a city with a lot of Masonic symbolism, its streets form drawings from the aerial view with a multitude of encrypted meanings.\nGematria: The power of 11 The 11 represents the Illuminati pyramid, it is the main symbol of the Illuminati, a number that multiplied by itself (11x11=121) forms an ascending and descending ladder of numbers, Pascal’s triangle fulfills the property of $11^n$ and by adding both sides of the multiplication the pyramid is preserved.\nDate: September 11 September 11 is a day of high Masonic ritualistic charge. In pure numerology there would be 111 days left until the end of the year. These are very important dates (War of Succession / Diada), the overthrow of Allende and the beginning of the dictatorship in Chile, the day the first single of the Beatles was recorded, the lifting of the iron curtain in Germany, the USSR withdraws troops from Cuba, countless “meetings” and meetings of presidents, etc.. Attacks on the 11th 9/11 - Attacks in New York and Arlington, USA. 11M - False flag bombing in Madrid, Spain. 11M - U.S. dropping of “atomic” bombs on Fukushima and Ngasaki, Japan. Conclusion The version that each one wants to accept is a personal fact, the important thing is to be aware of it, to have one’s own opinion and not to be carried away by fear, which is what a terrorist or deep state side is looking for. Nor should we act in a vindictive way because then we will increase the problem and give the result they are looking for, violence and chaos to impose their order.\nThe official version is made to make us ignorant and hide information from hidden powers acting in the shadows. You may not want to accept an alternative version for fear of thinking that this reality exists, but it is better to know it because then you have room for action and correction to create a better world.\nReferences Wikipedia (official version) September 11 attacks WTC 1973 - 2001 WTC 2001 - present History WTC September 11 Collection - Archive.org Understanding 9/11 - Archive.org Collapse of World Trade Center Snopes (fact checker) - WTC terrorism insurance https://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/09/22/rec.buried.treasure/index.html Alternative version Bibliotecapleyades - WTC 11S - Human Progressivism 11S - Awakenings.org Investigate11s Jim Do Free 911 Primate twin towers | Awakenings.org False flag 911 | Counter currents 360 FAq to were the Twin Towers designed to wtihstand the impact of the airplanes 9/11 conspiracy theories ",

<p>September 11, 2001 is remembered as the biggest terrorist attack in the recent history of the 21st century, which caused a worldwide commotion and changed the economy of all countries since it occurred in Manhattan, New York in the offices of the economic center of the United States and the world. This event brought with it the increase of security measures in the fight against terrorism and the consequent wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The most shocking news and with more repercussion in the media was the collapse of the twin towers (WTC1 and WTC2) due to the crash of two airplanes hijacked by the terrorist group al-Qaeda, in the televisions were distributed videos where a plane hit one of the twin towers and later other videos taken from another angle. However, without going off the record, it is not widely known that more buildings were affected that same day in the same area including WTC 3 and seven hours later the total collapse of WTC 7.</p>
<p>As time went by, groups and movements arose to know the truth about the 9/11 attacks, the subject became a conspiracy topic and many people began to doubt the official version distributed by the media, but it is not necessary to conspire to doubt the facts because reviewing the official documentation there are flaws and inconsistencies that make you rethink the facts. In Wikipedia itself, the &ldquo;Discussion&rdquo; and English section is full of debate with ideas that differ from the official version.</p>
<p>This article tries to summarize the official version of the facts and argue a more realistic alternative point of view to understand the <em>When, Where, What, What, How, Who and Why</em> or <em>When, Where, What, How, Who and Why</em>. These facts represent a very strong drama for the society, that&rsquo;s why I do it with all my respect for the victims and their relatives.</p>
<h1 id="official-version">Official version<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#official-version">#</a></h1>
<p>As of today in 2022, the major sources for information about the official version of the 9/11 attacks are Wikipedia (online encyclopedia) with detailed articles with hundreds of quotes and Archive.org (California online library) with a database of video recordings. In 2001, cell phones barely existed and did not have video cameras, but the media and some people recorded the fires and the cause of the explosions in the towers.</p>
<p>The official investigations of the events of September 11, established that the 9/11 attacks were of an Islamic terrosite nature with the hijacking of planes that ended up crashing into the U.S. world economic headquarters in New York (WTC), the headquarters of the Department of Defense (the Pentagon) and another plane bound for the Capitol (Washington DC) that managed to evade the hijackers and ended up losing control crashing in an open field in Shakesville.</p>
<h2 id="official-event">Official event<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#official-event">#</a></h2>
<p>On Tuesday, September 11, 2001 between 8:46 - 10:28 a series of attacks took place which became known as 9/11 or 9/11. On that day the DoD (Department of Defense) had planned a series of military exercises to simulate an air raid on New York.</p>
<p>The sites affected by the attack were:</p>
<ol>
<li>WTC (World Trace Center) in Manhattan, New York.</li>
<li>The Pentagon (DoD (Department of Defense) Center) located in Arlington, Virginia, suffered structural damage to the West ring of the building.</li>
<li>United Airlines plane 93, crashes in the Shanksville, Pennsylvania wasteland.</li>
</ol>
<p>The three sites affected during 9/11 are located in the eastern United States. Arlington (Virginia) and Washington D.C. are very close to each other at 9 km distance separated by the Potomac River, while New York is north of them at 370 km distance.</p>

<p>The Pentagon is the logistics center of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), built between September 11, 1941 and January 15, 1943. It is home to the FBI and CIA.</p>

<p>The World Trade Center (WTC) was the most important economic center in the world at the time, located in Manhattan (New York, United States).
The financial complex was composed of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Towers_2">Twin Towers</a>: tallest skyscrapers in the world until their collapse on 9/11.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_World_Trade_Center#Original_building">WTC 1</a> (north tower) with 110 floors and 410 meters high. A 110-meter-tall telecommunications antenna was added in 1978.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_World_Trade_Center#Original_building_(1973-2001)">WTC 2</a> (south tower) with 110 floors and 410 meters high.</li>
</ul>

A 22-story hotel with 825 rooms, it connected the North Tower (WTC 1) with the South Tower (WTC 2).</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_World_Trade_Center#Original_building_(1975-2001)">WTC 4</a></li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_World_Trade_Center#Original_building_(1987-2001)">WTC 7</a></li>
<li>The complex had suffered three attacks in the course of history, before the total collapse.</li>
<li>On a typical day, 50,000 people were working with more than 430 companies involved.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Construction (1965 - 1973)
<ul>
<li>Builder: Minoru Yamasaki, Emery Roth &amp; Sons</li>
<li>Financed by the Rockefeller family, similar in style to the Rockefeller Center buildings in midtown Manhattan spaced just 6 km apart in a straight line.</li>
<li>The grandson of Standard Oil founder John D. Rockefeller, David Rockefeller decided to revive the WTC concept as the core of revitalized lower Manhattan. In May 1959, Rockefeller formed the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association, invested $250 million near the Fish Market on the East River, including a single tower with 70 stores and several smaller buildings.
Reconstruction (2001 - 2013) 2.</li>
<li>Rebuild: Larry Silverstein (Silverstein Properties), Daniel Libeskind (both Jewish).</li>
<li>New complex includes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_World_Trade_Center">One World Trade Center</a>, a high-rise building being planned at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_World_Trade_Center">World Trade Center 2</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_World_Trade_Center">World Trade Center 3</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_World_Trade_Center">World Trade Center 4</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_World_Trade_Center">World Trade Center 7</a>, and another office building.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Private actions
<ul>
<li>Between 1998 - 2001 the WTC was privatized.</li>
<li>A few months before the event, the lease of the World Trade Center was sold to Larry Silverstein along with GMAC Commercial Mortgage (a subsidiary of General Motors), Westfield America Inc and real estate investor Lloyd Goldman. Silverstein took out insurance that &ldquo;fortuitously&rdquo; covered terrorism. After 9/11, Silverstein took the insurance company to court, claiming they should pay him double because there were two attacks. He won and was awarded $4,550,000,000.</li>

<h3 id="data">Data<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#data">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>WTC 1, WTC 2, WTC 3 (Marriott WTC) and WTC 7 collapse completely, the remaining three buildings (WTC 4, WTC 5, WTC 6) were damaged and subsequently demolished.</li>
<li>The Deutsche Bank building closes after 9/11 due to radioactive contamination of the site, during the following months high radiation levels are recorded.</li>
<li>NIST estimated about 17,400 people were in the WTC that day, yet only 2,753 deaths were certified. The attacks caused 2,977 fatalities, more than 25,000 injuries and considerable long-term health consequences, in addition to at least $10 billion in infrastructure and property damage.</li>
<li>In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, suspicion quickly fell on Al Qaeda and its leader Bin Laden. The United States formally responded by launching the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, who had not complied with U.S. demands to expel Al Qaeda from Afghanistan and extradite their leader Bin Laden.</li>
<li>Officially the attacks were organized by the Islamic terrorist gang Al-Qaeda, which was in charge of hijacking the planes and crashing them. Their alleged motives were due to:
<ul>
<li>U.S. support for Israel</li>
<li>Support for &ldquo;anti-Muslim attacks&rdquo; in Somalia</li>
<li>Support for the Philippines against Muslims in the Moro conflict</li>
<li>Support for Israeli &ldquo;aggression&rdquo; against Muslims in Lebanon</li>
<li>Support for Russia&rsquo;s &ldquo;atrocities against Muslims&rdquo; in Chechnya</li>
<li>Support for pro-U.S. governments in the Middle East (who &ldquo;act as their agents&rdquo;) against Muslim interests</li>

<h2 id="inconsistencies">Inconsistencies<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#inconsistencies">#</a></h2>
<p>In the official version there are many incongruities and coincidences that raise doubts.</p>
<ol>
<li>On September 10, 11 and 12, 2001 the Department of Defense (DoD) had planned a series of military exercises over New York City simulating an air raid, a situation that caused great confusion at the actual time of the attack. The previous days New York City suffered a 36-hour power outage. In addition, all WTC personnel along with the CIA, nSA and FBI were relocated to other offices.</li>
<li>The version of the plane crash at WTC does not fit:
<ol>
<li>The Empire State had suffered in 1945 the impact of a B-25 bomber plane and did not collapse.</li>
<li>Sabotaging the cockpit of an airplane, with only the contents of the cockpit, is complicated due to the security doors.</li>
<li>The F16 stealth planes did not go to intercept the hijacked airliners despite deviating from the route. Donald Rumsfeld, DoD Secretary, denied the takeoff order.</li>
<li>If the planes had been hijacked from the beginning why did they make a detour to attack the towers and did not go directly.</li>
<li>To hit two planes at low altitude at that speed is very complicated.</li>
<li>There were no remains of the black boxes of the planes, nor the fuselage of these. There are videos that show explosions on the floors without plane crashes and there are people who affirm it. The videos that show a plane crash show that the plane goes through the building and then breaks the structure. And in the alleged photographs the plane is completely black with no shades of light.</li>
<li>No passengers were identified from the plane nor any remains of them, however the IDs of the eight terrorists were found in good condition allowing them to be identified.</li>
<li>A newscast tells the news of the fall of WTC 7 before its collapse with live images of the building standing. Shortly after, there is a cut in the transmission, with loss of the green image typical of explosions.</li>
<li>WTC 7 collapsed 7 hours later and did not suffer any collision of artifacts. According to the official version, it collapsed due to fires in the base. No building in history has ever collapsed due to fire risk, let alone in 6 seconds.</li>
<li>Frank A. DeMartini, manager of the construction of the WTC, assured in a documentary of the &ldquo;History&rdquo; channel recorded in January 2001 that: &ldquo;The towers were structurally designed for the collision of 707 airplanes, the largest at that time&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The fall of the towers WTC1 and WTC2, is completely vertical starting from the base, if it were due to the weight of the airplanes they would fall from top to bottom and it was not the case.</li>
<li>The firemen who were helping heard a loud noise before the collapse of the building.</li>
<li>Buildings that have been shot at by missiles break into pieces and fall in the direction of the missile.</li>
<li>The size caused in the explosions of the building does not correspond to that of the airplanes, since it has greater amplitude and does not present the form of the airplanes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The crash of a plane into the Pentagon does not fit either:
<ol>
<li>The size of the gap generated by the impacted object does not correspond to the shape of an airplane.</li>
<li>An airplane can&rsquo;t fly at ground level that fast.</li>
<li>The intermediate frames of the video of the object hitting the Pentagon were deleted.</li>
<li>Senior personnel did not show up for work that day, including senior managers. The NSA, FBI and CIA were given the day off. Far fewer people than expected came to work at the WTC offices despite it being a Tuesday.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Money at stake:
<ol>
<li>300 billion dollars worth of gold, silver and other precious metals were removed from underneath the WTC basement.</li>
<li>Several entities and groups took advantage of the fall in the stock market to gain multi-million dollar shares.</li>
<li>The Silversteins insured WTC1 and WTC2 for risk of terrorist attack months before the event, and took the insurer to court because they only contemplated one attack and not one for each tower, won the trial and doubled their value to $4.55 billion.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Witnesses:
Witnessed bombs exploding in the buildings. 2.
2. Firefighters heard the sound of an explosion before the buildings collapsed.</li>
<li>Independent investigations and testimonies:
<ol>
<li>The former president stated that it could only have been provoked by the explosion of bombs. 2.</li>
<li>Jet fuel (kerosene) can at best burn at 1700ºF and 2950ºF as in the towers, many scientists claim that military explosive could have been used to melt the steel bases. Among them, Physicist Steven Jones claims that the WTC7 building and the Twin Towers were brought down not only by fire and damage resulting from the impact, but by cutting explosives installed in advance at the base of the buildings. He considered official reports from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the 9/11 Commission that the fires coupled with impact damage alone caused the complete toppling of the three buildings. And I present evidence for the controlled demolition hypothesis, suggested by the available data, which can be tested.</li>
<li>Morgan Reynolds, a former advisor and economic advisor to the George W. Bush administration during his first term (now professor emeritus of economics at Texas A&amp;M University), declared that the government&rsquo;s story is &ldquo;bogus&rdquo; and that the incident was artificially created. In a June 13, 2005 article in the Washington Times, Reynolds said, &ldquo;It is impossible to deny the existence of the scientific debate surrounding the real causes of the collapse of the Twin Towers and Tower 7. Only a professional, controlled demolition can explain all the elements proven in the investigation into the collapse of the three buildings.&rdquo;</li>
<li>No plane crashed in the Pentagon, but a missile exploded, this was supported by a statement made by Donald Rumsfeld himself in an interview to a press media, something that it was thought he would never admit.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The attacks served as an excuse for:
<ol>
<li>The fight against terrorism and the increase of security measures at all levels.</li>
<li>The war against Afghanistan, the war against the Middle East and the search and capture of Osama Bin Laden (member of al-Qaeda).</li>
<li>Gaining control of oil in the Middle East.</li>
<li>Justification for attacking Afghanistan, creating wars, imposing new measures and changing the world economy.</li>
<li>The 9/11 documentaries and films reinforce the idea of revenge, fight terrorism by focusing on hatred towards Islamic terrorists.	And invest more in armaments and in the military sector.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The plane enters without breaking the structure and then you see the explosion. Moreover, depending on the video it looks more realistic or more fake, and even in some of them you can only see the explosion without the impact of the plane.</li>

</ul>
<p>All these incongruities and coincidences show that the official version is false, it contains true elements but has several falsified facts to hide the real perpetrators and to point out an enemy to take advantage of.</p>
<p>Another important point is that from the first moment there was an impetus and way of acting on the part of the press and politics focused on revenge and capture of the attackers, instead of avoiding confrontation and trying to seek peace and restore order. It was already practicing it before with media programming (movies, series, news). The motives of the al-Qaeda group do not really carry much weight if compared to a premeditated attack by groups and lodges that made a great profit from it. These groups in turn would be hidden in the shadows and as long as there was no suspicion no one would be able to expose them.</p>
<h2 id="what-really-happened">What really happened?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-really-happened">#</a></h2>
<p>The place and the sites affected are real, what is not certain is how it happened and who was behind it.</p>
<p>The towers did not collapse perfectly vertically by the collision of two planes, it is impossible that one plane brought down the structure of WTC 1 and then another WTC 2. &ldquo;The steel structure of the towers was designed for the collision of Boeing 707 planes (the largest at the time)&rdquo; said by the tenants themselves, physical simulations go against a possible structural collapse by the collision of planes. Now, if it is true that there were explosions, they were most likely installed bombs or devices dropped from outside, one article points to <a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_911_41.htm">shots from the Woolworth building</a>, while at the base controlled explosives were used, with nano-thermite bombs that melted and cut the steel columns in seconds.</p>
<p>The plane crash I rule out for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>many witnesses saw the explosion and saw no aircraft impact.</li>
<li>The videos shown are not proof of it, as they look quite fake, they can be manipulated and there are other videos recorded of the same explosion where there is no plane impacting.</li>
<li>There are no airplane fuselage remains in the WTC, there are no remains of the black boxes.</li>
<li>The routes traveled by the planes having been hijacked from the beginning is to turn backwards, which does not make sense since it takes much longer. Maybe that point was to make landings and then follow the route in some way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding the Pentagon attack it was not a plane either, this one simpler to understand. Here there is only one video available, which deleted the intermediate frames where the object was seen moving. Again there is no debris from the plane and the gap generated does not fit with a Boeing 757. It was a missile, this was acknowledged by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in a press question and Army Commander Albert Stubblebine said it was a missile and the explosions of the twin towers by controlled explosives.</p>
<p>Now what happened to the four passenger planes that were allegedly hijacked and died crashing is more complex. There are several hypotheses here:</p>
<ol>
<li>The planes take the normal route and landed earlier at a point where:
<ol>
<li>their identification is changed or they are destroyed.</li>
<li>Then a false signal is sent from the plane or else the radar is manipulated to the point of the attack.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Passengers:
<ol>
<li>They are either pre-selected to change their lives or are eliminated.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The &ldquo;terrorists&rdquo; in charge of hijacking the plane were paid actors who would later remain alive.</li>
</ol>
<p>The plane crash in Pennsylvania, it is more difficult to know if it actually crashed or not. The people in the area did not hear any impact and it was not corroborated hours later. That plane was supposedly a terrorist attack on the Capitol in Washington D.C., the perfect cover for thinking that no high-ranking U.S. politicians could have been involved because it would have affected them.</p>
<h2 id="who-was-behind-it">Who was behind it?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#who-was-behind-it">#</a></h2>
<p>The best way to sneak around and hide as the perpetrator is to blame others so you don&rsquo;t get caught. Knowing that the official version makes no sense because of all the physical and logical inconsistencies, it shows that who is behind the support of these investigations are those who want to hide the information.
The real perpetrators were the deep state, powerful families, high political officials, sectors of the NSA, the CIA, the FBI, Masonic lodges (specifically Judeo-Masons) and Zionists. The security agencies of several countries were also involved, including England (MI6), Israel (Mossad) and Saudi Arabia. The point is that it was organized in advance from the top.</p>
<p>The 9/11 attacks were a false flag attack (inside job) with multiple targets. Bin Laden and AlQaeda were actors who even had relationships with American politicians like the Clintons, Obama, Bush, there are pictures of friendship in the past. It was an attack organized from the Deep State, they had it planned from the date of its creation.</p>
<p>The fact that it was organized for a long time, even planned since its construction we can see it in the predictive programming of the media used as a negative primate to slow down the learning process in the audience and condition it.</p>
<h2 id="why-did-they-do-it">Why did they do it?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-did-they-do-it">#</a></h2>
<p>The why of the events is the hardest question and the one that has the most value. Why would anyone do harm to others even to their own people, for what purpose. A group of terrorists with box cutters and aircraft piloting skills is not capable of making a seamless attack let alone with the motives mentioned, as it was suicide.</p>
<p>By means of a false flag attack, the shadowy perpetrators can justify any recrimination:</p>
<ol>
<li>It allows to change the world economy and politics.</li>
<li>It allows to invest much more money in the military sector to fight &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; and justify wars like the one in the Middle East.</li>
<li>It allows invading territories and stealing oil in the countries causing &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo;.</li>
<li>It allows to subdue the population through fear to make it more moldable and controllable.</li>
<li>It allows to channel the energy of general thought to focus it on an idea.</li>
<li>Allows for greater power and control.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="false-flag-attacks">False flag attacks<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#false-flag-attacks">#</a></h2>
<p>The United States is already known for its false flag attacks, throughout history it has used it several times as a pretext and justification for wars or a specific purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li>Explosion of the battleship Maine (own ship) by the United States to declare war on Spain and invade Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines.</li>
<li>Attack of Pearl Harbor, the ships were not notified of a Japanese invasion. With this pretext they could drop bombs on the civilian population of Japan and thus demand its surrender.</li>
<li>Sinking of the Titanic, several families were on board the ship to vote on the creation of the Federal Reserve, those who were in favor of its creation never set sail while the families who opposed it died at sea. This allowed the creation of the Federal Reserve by majority vote, which was used years later to finance both sides of World War I and World War II. In addition to money laundering and control.</li>
</ul>
<p>They seek war because they seek the desire to control, to conquer, to impose and thus gain more power. The objective is an energetic control is to channel the emanated energy and nourish themselves with it. If there is no one to invade, they would not be so interested in invading.</p>
<p>And those in charge of this role are a series of groups and lodges that seek that power and that in part they have it because of the way the system has been structured.</p>
<p>The groups that intervened are difficult to know with totality but one can count Freemasonry (in particular by Jews), the agencies of the American government (NSA, CIA, FBI) and the MOSSAB (Isreal&rsquo;s agency), the Rockefeller family, the Bush family and the Silversteins and high positions of Washington&rsquo;s politics.</p>
<p>Within the State bodies many would not support such a cause but like any pyramid system, the lower ranks need not know.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#programming">#</a></h2>
<p>Before the attack dozens of artists made warnings of an attack on September 1, 2001 at the WTC, either on albums like (Michael Jackson), in a live concert like Prince (Osam Bin Laden getting ready to bomb 2001. Let&rsquo;s go!), a writer warned that Bin Laden would be blamed months before the attacks, the singer of Oasis and much more that I have not mentioned.</p>
<p>And hundreds of media, including comics, series, movies, cartoons, showed the fall of the towers and the plane bombing long before September 11, 2001, as a method of programming.</p>

The Simpsons put on a magazine cover that reads New York 9 11 (eleven formed by the twin towers) and the money symbol (dollar). The magazine costs $9 dollars but the towers are purposely placed forming an 11.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/9-11/Programming-9-11/MichaelJackson-BoodintheDanceFloor.jpg" alt=""  />

Michael Jackson&rsquo;s cover explains the whole 9-11 bombing in New York. Michael marks 9:11 on an imaginary clock, he dances on top of a black and white checkered floor (of Freemasonry), in the background there is an explosion and WTC 1 is gone. She is dressed in blood red and there is a crescent moon as on September 1, 2001, referring to the sacrifice. He also wears a mourning on his right arm raised.</p>
<p>Here I leave video compilation of predictive programs in the media, about 140 appearances refer to the twin towers and the pentagon with 9-11 being demolished with gunfire, bombs, planes, narratives of why they did it and with direct references to Freemasonry. After the attacks, much of the information containing references to 9/11 was removed because it was sensitive to the victims. In addition, censorship was applied to anyone who tried to seriously expose the facts and anyone who disagreed with the official version was ridiculed.</p>
