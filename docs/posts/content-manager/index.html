When it comes to classifying information we do the same whether in a physical environment with a folio or a digital one with an electronic device. In a physical environment to classify information we write in notebooks, notepads, blackboards; while in a digital environment we need tools that adapt.\nTo digitally organize the information that abounds and sometimes exceeds, it is essential to follow a good method of categorization or workflow and have the necessary tools to facilitate the process. In this way we will achieve an orderly system that is easier to consult and study, even for people who know the subject.\nThe categorization method is a personal matter, but the software used is universal for everyone. This type of software focused on file organization is called managers. Depending on the use there are several types, in this article we will mention the most relevant ones.\nBackup manager Backup managers are essential to keep files synchronized between devices and storage sources. In order to avoid file loss and keep devices up to date.\nFreeFileSync. One of the best folder comparison and synchronization software (cross-platform, open-source and free) for creating and managing file backups. Duplicati. A backup client that securely stores encrypted, incremental and compressed backups on local storage, cloud storage services and remote file servers. RClone. Like rsync but in the cloud, it is a command-line program for synchronizing files and directories to and from different cloud storage providers. Syncthing. Open, reliable and decentralized app. Data is stored privately in a selectable storage location. Time Machine. A popular Mac app that allows you to back up and roll back in time to that state of the machine. Files can also be synchronized via terminal commands:\nrobocopy. This is a Windows command that allows backups to be made between two directory paths. rsync. An open source utility that provides fast incremental file transfer, it is completely free to download. cp. Linux command for copy files and directories. ´cp [OPTION] filename destinationDirectory´. [Option]=-f,-h,-i,-n,-p,-r, –backup. File manager File managers are the oldest and best known software for organizing all types of files, they are usually general viewers and file metadata editors. They are not usually compatible with the files since they require players, editors, etc. They are usually in a graphical environment or in their simplest form file listings in the command terminal.\nGraphical file manager For Android (mobile) Cx Explorer, Oppo File Manager, Solid Explorer, FX File Explorer, X-plore File Manager. For Linux 4 pane. 4Pane is a multi-pane, detailed-list file manager for Linux. Caja - Mate desktop DDE file manager DMenu Dolphin - KDE. The most complete file manager of KDE Plasma desktop.

File manager similar to Windows but with better graphical interface, open-source and color-coded labeling. XYplorer. File manager with multiple options and view formats for Windows. Windows File Explorer. Windows File Explorer is one of Microsoft’s oldest and best-known applications for managing files locally. Little has changed since its inception and despite that it is still very useful, indicating the good design since its inception. It allows you to view and organize all types of files with multiple views, sort by filters and view folders with tree structure with directory paths. The downside is that there is no labeling and no improvements over time. Multiplatform Browser: Chromium (Google Chrome, Brave, MS Edge, Opera, Vivaldi), Firefox (Librewolf). read and open files with the route path on the browser: file:///C:/ . Double Commander TagSpaces. File manager with own tagging (includes geotags), by two methods: changing the name or adding a json in a database of your own. Terminal file manager For Linux Cfiles.

Library manager The library managers have a general use for categorizing and displaying almost all types of formats, they are the most extensive in terms of their own display.\nAdobe Bridge. Adobe Bridge is a powerful creative asset manager that allows you to preview, organize, edit and publish multiple creative assets quickly and easily. Edit metadata. Add keywords, tags, and ratings to assets. Organize assets using collections and find assets using powerful filters and advanced metadata search capabilities. Optimal for the Adobe suite, but requires an account and is paid monthly. Eagle.cool. The best file manager focused for designers with images but with an expandable use to all types of files. The user interface is very elegant and well designed, visually there are two side panels with information and in the middle the file list. In the left panel is the structural part, with three blocks: General tagging with 7 sections (“All, Uncategorized, Untagged, Untagged, Recent, Shuffle, Tag manager, Trash”. Smart folders and folder shortcuts. Folder tree listing. Folder encryption with password. In the right panel you can find the metadata associated to each file (thumbnail, similar color, file name, tagging, notes, url, folders, properties (score, dimensions, duration, size, type, creation date and modification date). The central part shows the file list that allows to find files by filters, multiple sorting options and button to perform actions for a set of tagging files. Files can be sorted according to customizable filters and it has multiple types of file view on screen. The downside is that it is paid and only supports two devices. And its storage library is only visible with the associated info by Eagle. Online manager DAM managers: Digitile.io, Damion, Canto, Infinity, Tagbox.io, Taglery.

Video manager There are few apps that are dedicated exclusively to video management, as it is usually included in file managers, gallery or library managers. And the few that there are are focused on pornography, although this use is simply optional.\nPorn Vault.

Music player: Musicolet, Musicoin, Nyx music player, Pi Music Player, Music PLayer (mytechnosound), Pulsar Music Player Note managers: Obsidian, Markor, SimplNote, GitJournal, Orgzly The “ideal” manager The perfect manager app should have the following features:\nLicense: open source (to be transparent against data usage). Cost: free (with donation) or one-time payment for life (maximum price 80 €). Compatibility: multiplatform (Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android). Privacy: private local app (no data sent to third parties). Interface: simple with a variety of themes (light and dark). Classification system: hierarchical structure with folders and directory path. General classification: Storage that preserves the directory structure. File labeling, punctuation, addition of metadata. File filtering by type or metadata. Saving of web pages (with offline reading option). Display of files with different views (details, icons, list, thumbnail). Sorting by file metadata (name, creation date, tag…). Advanced search panel. Current directory path panel. Graphical viewers: tree structure and graph viewer. Supported file formats. Playable formats: Audio (aac, aiff, dsd, flac, mp3, wav, wma). Documents (csv, docx, epub, html, md, pdf, txt, xml). Image (bmp, gif, jpg, png, psd, raw, svg, tiff, web). Video (avi, divx, flv, mp4, mov, mkv, webm). Editable formats (optional): Audio. Speed, trim and pitch editing. Documents. Plain text editing. Image. Contrast, brightness, saturation, shadows and color editing. Videos. Editing of audio + image values. The “ideal” manager would be a mix of: Eagle.cool for the file display, interface and group tagging. Windows Explorer or Files for its filtering and organization options. Obsdian.md for its graph viewer, customizable interface and compatible plugins. TagSpaces for its geotagging, allowing to keep the folder structure. My favorite to date is Eagle.cool but the problem is that it does not allow to open all files internally (although for that there are editors) and its storage is in a library of the program itself with a folder per file with (name.xyz + name_minuature.xyz + name.json) which makes the file transfer much slower by the number of folders created. Another point against it is that it only allows two devices with Windows or Mac registry. Another very useful manager is Files, the modern and open-source version of the well-known Windows explorer, with color labeling, multi-window and a variety of themes. The bad thing is that it is only for Windows, the view of folders is hierarchical and the labeling is basic without grouping or the possibility of exporting.\nAs a fact to add metadata to the files an external database is needed, since normally the files according to the format come with their own metadata limit. This makes it necessary to add files with extra information (info-extra.json) and the folder structure changes. One way to preserve the directory structure is to add the metadata in the file name but this is a limited method.\nConclusion The software used to manage files is a good tool to classify information and facilitate the work of collecting and learning. But at the end of the day what matters is the objective you want to achieve with these data, you can vary the method until you find the one you like the most or the one you are most comfortable with.\nReferences Apps for organize content - AlternativeTo Synchronise Your Offline Notes Across All Devices Without the Cloud What’s the Best Software for Tagging Files?

<p>As living beings to obtain information, we make use of data and we store them in our mind, that is to say, we organize the data in our database (the mind) and we mold them internally, that is to say, we shape the interior or in other words, we in-form ourselves to learn and obtain knowledge.
When it comes to classifying information we do the same whether in a physical environment with a folio or a digital one with an electronic device. In a physical environment to classify information we write in notebooks, notepads, blackboards; while in a digital environment we need tools that adapt.</p>
<p>To digitally organize the information that abounds and sometimes exceeds, it is essential to follow a good method of categorization or workflow and have the necessary tools to facilitate the process. In this way we will achieve an orderly system that is easier to consult and study, even for people who know the subject.</p>
<p>The categorization method is a personal matter, but the software used is universal for everyone. This type of software focused on file organization is called <strong>managers</strong>. Depending on the use there are several types, in this article we will mention the most relevant ones.</p>
<h1 id="backup-manager">Backup manager<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#backup-manager">#</a></h1>
<p>Backup managers are essential to keep files synchronized between devices and storage sources. In order to avoid file loss and keep devices up to date.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Files can also be synchronized via terminal commands:</p>

<li><a href="https://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a>. An open source utility that provides fast incremental file transfer, it is completely free to download.</li>
<li>cp. Linux command for copy files and directories.

</ul>
<h1 id="file-manager">File manager<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#file-manager">#</a></h1>
<p>File managers are the oldest and best known software for organizing all types of files, they are usually general viewers and file metadata editors. They are not usually compatible with the files since they require players, editors, etc. They are usually in a graphical environment or in their simplest form file listings in the command terminal.</p>

<li>The &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; manager would be a mix of:
<ul>
<li>Eagle.cool for the file display, interface and group tagging.</li>
<li>Windows Explorer or Files for its filtering and organization options.</li>
<li>Obsdian.md for its graph viewer, customizable interface and compatible plugins.</li>
<li>TagSpaces for its geotagging, allowing to keep the folder structure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My favorite to date is Eagle.cool but the problem is that it does not allow to open all files internally (although for that there are editors) and its storage is in a library of the program itself with a folder per file with (name.xyz + name_minuature.xyz + name.json) which makes the file transfer much slower by the number of folders created. Another point against it is that it only allows two devices with Windows or Mac registry.
Another very useful manager is Files, the modern and open-source version of the well-known Windows explorer, with color labeling, multi-window and a variety of themes. The bad thing is that it is only for Windows, the view of folders is hierarchical and the labeling is basic without grouping or the possibility of exporting.</p>
<p>As a fact to add metadata to the files an external database is needed, since normally the files according to the format come with their own metadata limit. This makes it necessary to add files with extra information (info-extra.json) and the folder structure changes. One way to preserve the directory structure is to add the metadata in the file name but this is a limited method.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h1>
<p>The software used to manage files is a good tool to classify information and facilitate the work of collecting and learning. But at the end of the day what matters is the objective you want to achieve with these data, you can vary the method until you find the one you like the most or the one you are most comfortable with.</p>
