      <description>Poem The distractions that envelop us are on the rise, Like lab mice, we feel trapped in a maze of incessant noise, A deluge of publications flood our senses, Creating illusions, veiling truths, stifling our defenses.
But amidst this chaos, do not let others dictate your course, For humans are not mere automatons, programmed to endorse. We are not clones, shackled by limitations, We are beings imbued with extraordinary inclinations.</description>

      <description>What is the truth? A Pa and a Jo talking.
Jo - If there are only 100 people in the world and they all think alike, that is, there is only one opinion, does that mean that there is only one truth, that there are more and they don&amp;rsquo;t know them or that they are wrong and don&amp;rsquo;t know it? Is truth a matter of being, exernal or the idea of a group of individuals?</description>

      <title>The importance of things</title>
      <link>https://curiosity432.xyz/posts/the-importance/</link>

      <description>The importance of things has nothing to do with form or content, nor with the material world around us. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the universe is infinite, flat, curved or spherical.
The importance is the love you have for something, the value you place on it, the appreciation you have for it.
The opinion that someone has about who created us, how the world was created, what we are, has no value if we don&amp;rsquo;t give it to them.</description>

      <title>What is the horizon?</title>

      <guid>https://curiosity432.xyz/posts/the-horizon/</guid>
      <description>Introduction. To answer this question let&amp;rsquo;s start by analyzing its etymology, the word &amp;ldquo;horizon&amp;rdquo; comes from the Ancient Greek ὁρίζων (horízōn, &amp;ldquo;definite boundary&amp;rdquo;) participle of the verb [ὁρίζω](https://en. wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BD%81%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%CE%B6%CF%89#Ancient_Greek &amp;ldquo;ὁρίζω&amp;rdquo;) (horízō, &amp;ldquo;to define, determine&amp;rdquo;) which comes from the noun ὅρος (hóros, &amp;ldquo;boundary&amp;rdquo;).
To observe the horizon a three-dimensional space is necessary, in higher physical dimensions it could also occur but with another geometry. It also requires a separation of media to observe it, in which the horizon forms the base that separates both media while the vertical would be the height, in the case of the earth the horizon separates the atmosphere from the land or sea surface.</description>
