  "articleBody": "Brief introduction In this article I am going to talk about Linux and give a broad view of this concept, since it is usually a somewhat technical subject and there is often confusion.\nIn general, Linux is an operating system, I am not going to go into detail about the concept of this term so as not to make this article heavy, but in itself it is the fundamental software to use a device, be it a computer, a mobile tablet or any other device that counts. with an electronic screen (televisions, printers with screens, microwaves with screens, drink machines, etc.). Today almost any electronic device has an integrated operating system, what happens is that the operating system for an induction hob is much simpler than that of a personal or mobile computer.\nFor an induction hob you only need to configure the button (on, off), change power button (0 to 9) and indicate the position of the hob, it is a very basic operating system programmed at a low level (with direct operation to the machine ). However, in a PC there are many integrated devices and many more tasks to bring together, it is a much more complex operating system with different layers of operation.\nUsually when you ask people ‘What operating system do you use on your computer?’ most will answer Windows (75% on PCs) or macOS (15% on PCs), since they are the two most used OS (Operating Systems) on a personal level because they come pre-installed from the factory, Windows comes with most brands of assembled laptops and desktop PCs, while macOS comes on Apple computers. The same happens with mobile phones, most of them come with versions of Android and those of Apple (28% mobile users) with iOS. The percentages are in computers: 77% Windows, 17% macOS, 6% other; while on mobile phones 72% Google, 27% iOS, 1% others.\nHowever, there is another OS much more used in total computing and that people do not know so much, this is Linux (GNU/Linux specifically). And how is it possible that it is more used and less known? Well, the answer is because it is the most used OS in servers, that is, the predominant software in computers that provide Internet service and there are much more servers than devices that receive service. In the case of servers, more than 90% are Linux, this is because the servers are computers without a screen that only require the command terminal to function, Linux commands are more standardized, they are more compatible for a web environment and the software is free of charge.\nOn the other hand, at the user level as a personal computer (PC) it does not exceed 7% and in the case of Android mobiles it is an open source OS based on Linux but belonging to Google.\nThere are many more operating systems but these three are the biggest and most powerful. Despite being used to perform similar tasks, there are big differences between them. Windows is proprietary software belonging to Microsoft, macOS (OS X) is proprietary to Apple, and Linux is based on the philosophy of open source and free, which does not mean free.\nLet’s talk Linux Linux is known as an operating system but strictly speaking it is the kernel of the OS that communicates with the rest of the programs and interacts with the hardware. Its full name is GNU/Linux. The combination of the name is due to GNU (GNU’s Not Unix! self-referenced name) project created by Richard Stallman (MIT student) in the 80s with the aim of creating a free and open source OS that would replace UNIX the OS of the time that it was proprietary and paid, while Linux comes from Linus Torvalds who initially contributed by sharing the code of an OS Kernel with the GNU project.\nOn September 27, 1983, Richard Stallman announced the GNU project, a project to promote control and freedom in the use of computers and the creation of free software. Eight years later, on September 17, 1991, after 9 months of work, Linus Torvalds contributed the code written for the kernel of the GNU operating system. At that time, the birth of Linux or specifically the Linux Kernel based on GNU is considered.\nJust as Microsoft is associated with its founder Bill Gates, Apple with Steve Jobs, Linux is associated with two people Linus Torvalds (creator of the Linux Kernel) and Richard Stallman (creator of the GNU project). Now the main difference between Linux and Windows and macOS is its work philosophy. The Linux operating system must mainly comply with the open source rule with different distribution licenses, although it is mostly offered free of charge, known as FOSS (Free and Open Source Software). Now, as Linux is only the Kernel, in order to have the rest of the parts that complete the operating system, Linux distributions arise.\nLinux Distros If we wanted to mount an operating system of zero customizable we would have to configure all the software to make that hardware work, in the case of Linux for a PC you would have to configure the Kernel and the rest of the software for that computer. For this reason, over time, what are known as Linux distributions have been developed, operating systems that facilitate the use and installation of the operating system for the user. Distros use the Linux kernel by adding a package installer, and may come with software pre-installed for direct use.\nThe distributions are usually open source, so it happens that the developers reuse code and the distros are derived. When a new distro appears based on an original one, that is, a branch is created in the code, it is known as a derived distro and if the same distro has different environments to install, it is known as flavors of the distribution. Today there are hundreds of Linux distributions but most are originally derived from a small handful.\n-Debian. Debian is one of the oldest distros from 1993. Ubuntu (ElementaryOS, Linux Mint, KDE Neon, PopOS, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Zorin), MX-Linux, Parrot, PureOS, Tails, Raspberry, Moodle…\nArch Linux created in 2002, from which derive ArchCraft, ArcoLinux, Artix, Black Arch, Garuda Linux, Hyperbola, Manjaro… Red Hat Linux (Fedora, Mandrake, Slafish OS, Cent OS, Mandriva (Mageia)) Gentoo created in the year 2000. Linux from Scratch, an installer that allows you to install Linux from scratch, released in 1999. Slackware, the first distro released in 1992. Suse (Open Suse, Gecko Linux), released in 1996. Independent distros: Nix OS (from 2003), KaOS (from KDE), Minimal Linux Live… In addition there are specific Linux distros for servers: Ubuntu Server, Debian, OpenSuse, Fedora Server; or specific distros like: ZeroShell, ClearLinux (from Intel), OviOS, LTSP. And for smartwatch (PineTime, Asteroid) or mobile (Android).\nThe most used distros are based on Debian, Arch and Red Hat (Fedora). And the main difference is the package installer they use, the software in charge of facilitating the installation of applications.\nDistrict Features Package Installer Debian (Ubuntu, Linux Mint) Stable distro for life, with 4 years of security updates apt,dpkg Red Hat Linux (Fedora) Updated by versions, more stable dnf, yum Arch Linux (ArchCraft, ArcoLinux, Black Arch, Garuda, Manjaro) Continuous update (possibly unstable), AUR Community Software Repository pac-man Depending on the level of difficulty:\nFor beginners: Debian-based with pre-installed system (Linux Mint, ElementaryOS, Ubuntu) For average users: based on Arch with pre-installed environment (Garuda Linux, ArcoLinux) or Red Hat (Fedora) For advanced users: Arch Linux (running scripts or typing commands), Slackware or Gentoo Ubuntu and Linx Mint (based on Debian) are very intuitive to use, they come with the operating system configured with a pre-installed desktop environment and an application installer. However, other distros only contain the Kernel with the package installer and a command terminal to make any changes, without a graphical interface where only the keyboard works.\nIn the case of Arch Linux, it is for somewhat more advanced users, it is necessary to know how to use the terminal to be able to install and configure the operating system to your liking, or also copy and paste the commands from the [Arch Linux installation guide](https ://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide). The classic way to configure Arch is by typing the commands in the terminal, although in the new versions it can be done by selecting a list of options after executing “archinstall” or by executing a script from an external or local server. All three make use of the command terminal, an element that gives instructions to the operating system.\nAmong them, I am now using ArcoLinux, which has a multitude of isos with different levels to install, focused on teaching the user and facilitating the installation of Arch. In addition, Arch has the advantage that it always works in the latest version, albeit sacrificing a bit of stability and has a large active community. And others that I recommend Fedora or Manjaro.\nInstall software on Linux Now what programs do we need to mount our own operating system, mainly:\nThe core of the system System launcher: systemd, dinit, runit, upstart, finit. Driver controller: bluetooth, wifi, printer, processor, graphics card. Desktop environment: KDE, GNOME, sway, bspwm, i3 Integrated Apps: Start Manager, Window Manager, Custom Desktop (Backgrounds, Icons, Fonts) Basic apps: terminal, file manager, browser, player, editor, utilities. When you get into Linux you discover that everything is configurable and you understand more deeply how a computer works internally.\nYou also understand that each distribution needs a package manager to be able to install the programs and that the console (command terminal) is much more important than you thought. Knowing the terminal commands and handling the use of ‘scripts’ makes you an advanced user, automating tasks, software installation and basic control of the machine.\nTo install apps on Linux, you must first know if they are compatible with our distribution, if so, we have several options:\nFrom the list of apps in the repository of your distribution Use the package installer of each distro. Example: on Arch pacman -S firefox, on Debian install apt-get -S firefox. With a graphical environment that executes the commands. Running a distro compatible file: Debian (.deb), Red Hat (.rpm) With a bash script and giving administrator permissions. Extracting the compressed files and installing them following the instructions. Compiling and installing the binaries from scratch. The number of native applications in Linux is not as high as in Windows, however it is more than enough to cover all needs. The problems come with the gaming theme and content editing, since private Windows or Mac programs are usually used.\nThe least benefited are those who work every day with Adobe, MS Office, Avid (ProTools), Steinber (Cubase), AutoDesk (AutoCAD, Maya, etc), Apple (Logic Pro), Ableton. None of these applications are compatible with Linux however there are ways to use native Microsoft Windows applications on Linux with what are known as emulators. The best known is WINE, which is used by Bottles, Lutris, Play on Linux, Proton to make installing WINE easier.\nLinux customization (ricing) Linux is very customizable so much that you can get lost in that world, but it is a matter of taste and try what you like best. The action of customizing the system interface in detail is known as ricing and there are communities dedicated to it in Reedit, in which people post their beautiful work environments, the best known is [r/UnixPorn](https:/ /www.reddit.com/r/unixporn).\nAdvantages and disadvantages Linux has many advantages, the main one is that it is open source and free which allows you to know how it works internally, most of the applications are free and there is a large community willing to help. It is also safer against malware because there are fewer users, so attackers focus less and it is more robust against cyberattacks, also in Linux you own your data there is no pre-installed tracking by mega-corporations like Apple , GOogle or Microsoft.\nThe main disadvantage is the incompatibility with the hardware due to the fact that its software is usually proprietary, certain keyboards or mice with lights, the light configuration becomes useless, some printers do not work either since they use private drivers.\nAnother disadvantage is that there are fewer applications compatible with Linux because the large companies that develop proprietary paid software do not develop for Linux since there are fewer users and most use FOSS, so there was no market.\nAmong the most famous are Adobe (Adobe Reader, Illustrator, Photoshop), Autodesk (AutoCAD, Maya), Microsoft (MS Office), Serif (Affinity Photo). In addition, the theme of games is focused on Windows, since Microsoft owns the largest video game studios. However, everything has a solution, there are alternatives to the level of proprietary applications and ways to run if necessary from a Windows emulator using Wine (Windows Emulator).\nLinux as a learning process Once we are able to configure our operating system, for example based on Arch Linux, we become more self-sufficient users who better understand how their system works. Also with the advantage of using free open source applications, in a safe and private environment, taking power away from digital macroecosystems with an imperialist vision such as Google, Apple, Microsoft…\nThere are more and more people who use open source operating systems and specifically based on Linux, since its installation today is very simple and there is a large community willing to answer questions.\nIf you are looking for privacy, open source and free applications / learn and better understand software / efficiency / minimalism / configure your system in detail, this is your operating system.\nLinux Conclusions Linux has many advantages, it is a safe, standardized, open source, free operating system, there is a large community and the software for it covers almost all needs. Also, if we know how to use the terminal well, we are demigods, we can do anything.\nLike everything you have to adapt but for that you have to try, once you adapt you will most likely like it and stay using Linux.\nPostscript If you want to switch to Linux you have to check that the hardware you use is compatible with Linux, and certain products will stop working the same if the drivers are unique to Windows or macOS. For example, certain printers work only with Windows, RGB light settings require drivers and not all of them are compatible with Linux and so on, so it is advisable to check when buying that the hardware is compatible with Linux.\nAlthough it is true that today companies are increasingly open to releasing code from old applications and the community is capable of creating applications that solve these problems.\nGrades Distros: acronym for distributions. Derivative distros: These are distros based on an original but independent. Distro Flavors: Distro with minor changes in appearance. Species of distros: they are complements for the same distribution. OS: Operating System.\nFOSS: Free and Open Source Software\nLinks GNU Philosophy (Open Source) List of apps - Arch Linux Linux distros list - LWN Linux distros list - Wikipedia ",

  <div class="post-content"><h2 id="brief-introduction">Brief introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#brief-introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>In this article I am going to talk about Linux and give a broad view of this concept, since it is usually a somewhat technical subject and there is often confusion.</p>
<p>In general, Linux is an operating system, I am not going to go into detail about the concept of this term so as not to make this article heavy, but in itself it is the fundamental software to use a device, be it a computer, a mobile tablet or any other device that counts. with an electronic screen (televisions, printers with screens, microwaves with screens, drink machines, etc.). Today almost any electronic device has an integrated operating system, what happens is that the operating system for an induction hob is much simpler than that of a personal or mobile computer.</p>
<p>For an induction hob you only need to configure the button (on, off), change power button (0 to 9) and indicate the position of the hob, it is a very basic operating system programmed at a low level (with direct operation to the machine ). However, in a PC there are many integrated devices and many more tasks to bring together, it is a much more complex operating system with different layers of operation.</p>
<p>Usually when you ask people &lsquo;What operating system do you use on your computer?&rsquo; most will answer Windows (75% on PCs) or macOS (15% on PCs), since they are the two most used OS (Operating Systems) on a personal level because they come pre-installed from the factory, Windows comes with most brands of assembled laptops and desktop PCs, while macOS comes on Apple computers. The same happens with mobile phones, most of them come with versions of Android and those of Apple (28% mobile users) with iOS.
The percentages are in computers: 77% Windows, 17% macOS, 6% other; while on mobile phones 72% Google, 27% iOS, 1% others.</p>
<p>However, there is another OS much more used in total computing and that people do not know so much, this is Linux (GNU/Linux specifically). And how is it possible that it is more used and less known? Well, the answer is because it is the most used OS in servers, that is, the predominant software in computers that provide Internet service and there are much more servers than devices that receive service. In the case of servers, more than 90% are Linux, this is because the servers are computers without a screen that only require the command terminal to function, Linux commands are more standardized, they are more compatible for a web environment and the software is free of charge.</p>
<p>On the other hand, at the user level as a personal computer (PC) it does not exceed 7% and in the case of Android mobiles it is an open source OS based on Linux but belonging to Google.</p>
<p>There are many more operating systems but these three are the biggest and most powerful. Despite being used to perform similar tasks, there are big differences between them. Windows is proprietary software belonging to Microsoft, macOS (OS X) is proprietary to Apple, and Linux is based on the philosophy of open source and free, which does not mean free.</p>
<h2 id="lets-talk-linux">Let&rsquo;s talk Linux<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#lets-talk-linux">#</a></h2>
<p>Linux is known as an operating system but strictly speaking it is the kernel of the OS that communicates with the rest of the programs and interacts with the hardware. Its full name is GNU/Linux. The combination of the name is due to GNU (GNU&rsquo;s Not Unix! self-referenced name) project created by Richard Stallman (MIT student) in the 80s with the aim of creating a free and open source OS that would replace UNIX the OS of the time that it was proprietary and paid, while Linux comes from Linus Torvalds who initially contributed by sharing the code of an OS Kernel with the GNU project.</p>
<p>On September 27, 1983, Richard Stallman announced the GNU project, a project to promote control and freedom in the use of computers and the creation of free software. Eight years later, on September 17, 1991, after 9 months of work, Linus Torvalds contributed the code written for the kernel of the GNU operating system. At that time, the birth of Linux or specifically the Linux Kernel based on GNU is considered.</p>
<p>Just as Microsoft is associated with its founder Bill Gates, Apple with Steve Jobs, Linux is associated with two people Linus Torvalds (creator of the Linux Kernel) and Richard Stallman (creator of the GNU project). Now the main difference between Linux and Windows and macOS is its work philosophy. The Linux operating system must mainly comply with the open source rule with different distribution licenses, although it is mostly offered free of charge, known as FOSS (Free and Open Source Software). Now, as Linux is only the Kernel, in order to have the rest of the parts that complete the operating system, Linux distributions arise.</p>
<h3 id="linux-distros">Linux Distros<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#linux-distros">#</a></h3>
<p>If we wanted to mount an operating system of zero customizable we would have to configure all the software to make that hardware work, in the case of Linux for a PC you would have to configure the Kernel and the rest of the software for that computer. For this reason, over time, what are known as Linux distributions have been developed, operating systems that facilitate the use and installation of the operating system for the user. Distros use the Linux kernel by adding a package installer, and may come with software pre-installed for direct use.</p>
<p>The distributions are usually open source, so it happens that the developers reuse code and the distros are derived. When a new distro appears based on an original one, that is, a branch is created in the code, it is known as a derived distro and if the same distro has different environments to install, it is known as flavors of the distribution. Today there are hundreds of Linux distributions but most are originally derived from a small handful.</p>
<p>-Debian. Debian is one of the oldest distros from 1993. Ubuntu (ElementaryOS, Linux Mint, KDE Neon, PopOS, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Zorin), MX-Linux, Parrot, PureOS, Tails, Raspberry, Moodle&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Arch Linux created in 2002, from which derive ArchCraft, ArcoLinux, Artix, Black Arch, Garuda Linux, Hyperbola, Manjaro&hellip;</li>
<li>Red Hat Linux (Fedora, Mandrake, Slafish OS, Cent OS, Mandriva (Mageia))</li>
<li>Gentoo created in the year 2000.</li>
<li>Linux from Scratch, an installer that allows you to install Linux from scratch, released in 1999.</li>
<li>Slackware, the first distro released in 1992.</li>
<li>Suse (Open Suse, Gecko Linux), released in 1996.</li>
<li>Independent distros: Nix OS (from 2003), KaOS (from KDE), Minimal Linux Live&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition there are specific Linux distros for servers: Ubuntu Server, Debian, OpenSuse, Fedora Server; or specific distros like: ZeroShell, ClearLinux (from Intel), OviOS, LTSP. And for smartwatch (PineTime, Asteroid) or mobile (Android).</p>
<p>The most used distros are based on Debian, Arch and Red Hat (Fedora). And the main difference is the package installer they use, the software in charge of facilitating the installation of applications.</p>

<p>Depending on the level of difficulty:</p>
<ul>
<li>For beginners: Debian-based with pre-installed system (Linux Mint, ElementaryOS, Ubuntu)</li>
<li>For average users: based on Arch with pre-installed environment (Garuda Linux, ArcoLinux) or Red Hat (Fedora)</li>
<li>For advanced users: Arch Linux (running scripts or typing commands), Slackware or Gentoo</li>
</ul>
<p>Ubuntu and Linx Mint (based on Debian) are very intuitive to use, they come with the operating system configured with a pre-installed desktop environment and an application installer. However, other distros only contain the Kernel with the package installer and a command terminal to make any changes, without a graphical interface where only the keyboard works.</p>
<p>In the case of Arch Linux, it is for somewhat more advanced users, it is necessary to know how to use the terminal to be able to install and configure the operating system to your liking, or also copy and paste the commands from the [Arch Linux installation guide](https ://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide). The classic way to configure Arch is by typing the commands in the terminal, although in the new versions it can be done by selecting a list of options after executing &ldquo;archinstall&rdquo; or by executing a script from an external or local server. All three make use of the command terminal, an element that gives instructions to the operating system.</p>
<p>Among them, I am now using ArcoLinux, which has a multitude of isos with different levels to install, focused on teaching the user and facilitating the installation of Arch. In addition, Arch has the advantage that it always works in the latest version, albeit sacrificing a bit of stability and has a large active community. And others that I recommend Fedora or Manjaro.</p>
<h3 id="install-software-on-linux">Install software on Linux<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#install-software-on-linux">#</a></h3>
<p>Now what programs do we need to mount our own operating system, mainly:</p>
<ol>
<li>The core of the system</li>
<li>System launcher: systemd, dinit, runit, upstart, finit.</li>
<li>Driver controller: bluetooth, wifi, printer, processor, graphics card.</li>
<li>Desktop environment: KDE, GNOME, sway, bspwm, i3</li>
<li>Integrated Apps: Start Manager, Window Manager, Custom Desktop (Backgrounds, Icons, Fonts)</li>
<li>Basic apps: terminal, file manager, browser, player, editor, utilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you get into Linux you discover that everything is configurable and you understand more deeply how a computer works internally.</p>
<p>You also understand that each distribution needs a package manager to be able to install the programs and that the console (command terminal) is much more important than you thought. Knowing the terminal commands and handling the use of &lsquo;scripts&rsquo; makes you an advanced user, automating tasks, software installation and basic control of the machine.</p>
<p>To install apps on Linux, you must first know if they are compatible with our distribution, if so, we have several options:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the list of apps in the repository of your distribution</li>
<li>Use the package installer of each distro. Example: on Arch <code>pacman -S firefox</code>, on Debian <code>install apt-get -S firefox</code>.</li>
<li>With a graphical environment that executes the commands.</li>
<li>Running a distro compatible file: Debian (.deb), Red Hat (.rpm)</li>
<li>With a bash script and giving administrator permissions.</li>
<li>Extracting the compressed files and installing them following the instructions.</li>
<li>Compiling and installing the binaries from scratch.</li>
</ol>
<p>The number of native applications in Linux is not as high as in Windows, however it is more than enough to cover all needs. The problems come with the gaming theme and content editing, since private Windows or Mac programs are usually used.</p>
<p>The least benefited are those who work every day with Adobe, MS Office, Avid (ProTools), Steinber (Cubase), AutoDesk (AutoCAD, Maya, etc), Apple (Logic Pro), Ableton. None of these applications are compatible with Linux however there are ways to use native Microsoft Windows applications on Linux with what are known as emulators. The best known is WINE, which is used by Bottles, Lutris, Play on Linux, Proton to make installing WINE easier.</p>
<h3 id="linux-customization-ricing">Linux customization (ricing)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#linux-customization-ricing">#</a></h3>
<p>Linux is very customizable so much that you can get lost in that world, but it is a matter of taste and try what you like best. The action of customizing the system interface in detail is known as ricing and there are communities dedicated to it in Reedit, in which people post their beautiful work environments, the best known is [r/UnixPorn](https:/ /www.reddit.com/r/unixporn).</p>
<h3 id="advantages-and-disadvantages">Advantages and disadvantages<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#advantages-and-disadvantages">#</a></h3>
<p>Linux has many advantages, the main one is that it is open source and free which allows you to know how it works internally, most of the applications are free and there is a large community willing to help. It is also safer against malware because there are fewer users, so attackers focus less and it is more robust against cyberattacks, also in Linux you own your data there is no pre-installed tracking by mega-corporations like Apple , GOogle or Microsoft.</p>
<p>The main disadvantage is the incompatibility with the hardware due to the fact that its software is usually proprietary, certain keyboards or mice with lights, the light configuration becomes useless, some printers do not work either since they use private drivers.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage is that there are fewer applications compatible with Linux because the large companies that develop proprietary paid software do not develop for Linux since there are fewer users and most use FOSS, so there was no market.</p>
<p>Among the most famous are Adobe (Adobe Reader, Illustrator, Photoshop), Autodesk (AutoCAD, Maya), Microsoft (MS Office), Serif (Affinity Photo). In addition, the theme of games is focused on Windows, since Microsoft owns the largest video game studios. However, everything has a solution, there are alternatives to the level of proprietary applications and ways to run if necessary from a Windows emulator using Wine (Windows Emulator).</p>
<h2 id="linux-as-a-learning-process">Linux as a learning process<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#linux-as-a-learning-process">#</a></h2>
<p>Once we are able to configure our operating system, for example based on Arch Linux, we become more self-sufficient users who better understand how their system works. Also with the advantage of using free open source applications, in a safe and private environment, taking power away from digital macroecosystems with an imperialist vision such as Google, Apple, Microsoft&hellip;</p>
<p>There are more and more people who use open source operating systems and specifically based on Linux, since its installation today is very simple and there is a large community willing to answer questions.</p>
<p>If you are looking for privacy, open source and free applications / learn and better understand software / efficiency / minimalism / configure your system in detail, this is your operating system.</p>
<h2 id="linux-conclusions">Linux Conclusions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#linux-conclusions">#</a></h2>
<p>Linux has many advantages, it is a safe, standardized, open source, free operating system, there is a large community and the software for it covers almost all needs. Also, if we know how to use the terminal well, we are demigods, we can do anything.</p>
<p>Like everything you have to adapt but for that you have to try, once you adapt you will most likely like it and stay using Linux.</p>
<h2 id="postscript">Postscript<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#postscript">#</a></h2>
<p>If you want to switch to Linux you have to check that the hardware you use is compatible with Linux, and certain products will stop working the same if the drivers are unique to Windows or macOS. For example, certain printers work only with Windows, RGB light settings require drivers and not all of them are compatible with Linux and so on, so it is advisable to check when buying that the hardware is compatible with Linux.</p>
<p>Although it is true that today companies are increasingly open to releasing code from old applications and the community is capable of creating applications that solve these problems.</p>
<h2 id="grades">Grades<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#grades">#</a></h2>
<p>Distros: acronym for distributions.
