      <description>What is the truth? A Pa and a Jo talking.
Jo - If there are only 100 people in the world and they all think alike, that is, there is only one opinion, does that mean that there is only one truth, that there are more and they don&amp;rsquo;t know them or that they are wrong and don&amp;rsquo;t know it? Is truth a matter of being, exernal or the idea of a group of individuals?</description>

      <title>The importance of things</title>

      <description>The importance of things has nothing to do with form or content, nor with the material world around us. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the universe is infinite, flat, curved or spherical.
The importance is the love you have for something, the value you place on it, the appreciation you have for it.
The opinion that someone has about who created us, how the world was created, what we are, has no value if we don&amp;rsquo;t give it to them.</description>
