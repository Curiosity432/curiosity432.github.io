      <description>Intro As living beings to obtain information, we make use of data and we store them in our mind, that is to say, we organize the data in our database (the mind) and we mold them internally, that is to say, we shape the interior or in other words, we in-form ourselves to learn and obtain knowledge. When it comes to classifying information we do the same whether in a physical environment with a folio or a digital one with an electronic device.</description>

      <title>The importance of things</title>

      <description>The importance of things has nothing to do with form or content, nor with the material world around us. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the universe is infinite, flat, curved or spherical.
The importance is the love you have for something, the value you place on it, the appreciation you have for it.
The opinion that someone has about who created us, how the world was created, what we are, has no value if we don&amp;rsquo;t give it to them.</description>

      <title>What is the horizon?</title>

      <description>Introduction. To answer this question let&amp;rsquo;s start by analyzing its etymology, the word &amp;ldquo;horizon&amp;rdquo; comes from the Ancient Greek ὁρίζων (horízōn, &amp;ldquo;definite boundary&amp;rdquo;) participle of the verb [ὁρίζω](https://en. wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BD%81%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%CE%B6%CF%89#Ancient_Greek &amp;ldquo;ὁρίζω&amp;rdquo;) (horízō, &amp;ldquo;to define, determine&amp;rdquo;) which comes from the noun ὅρος (hóros, &amp;ldquo;boundary&amp;rdquo;).
To observe the horizon a three-dimensional space is necessary, in higher physical dimensions it could also occur but with another geometry. It also requires a separation of media to observe it, in which the horizon forms the base that separates both media while the vertical would be the height, in the case of the earth the horizon separates the atmosphere from the land or sea surface.</description>
