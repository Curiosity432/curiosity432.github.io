[{"content":"Intro September 11, 2001 is remembered as the biggest terrorist attack in the recent history of the 21st century, which caused a worldwide commotion and changed the economy of all countries since it occurred in Manhattan, New York in the offices of the economic center of the United States and the world. This event brought with it the increase of security measures in the fight against terrorism and the consequent wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East.\nThe most shocking news and with more repercussion in the media was the collapse of the twin towers (WTC1 and WTC2) due to the crash of two airplanes hijacked by the terrorist group al-Qaeda, in the televisions were distributed videos where a plane hit one of the twin towers and later other videos taken from another angle. However, without going off the record, it is not widely known that more buildings were affected that same day in the same area including WTC 3 and seven hours later the total collapse of WTC 7.\nAs time went by, groups and movements arose to know the truth about the 9/11 attacks, the subject became a conspiracy topic and many people began to doubt the official version distributed by the media, but it is not necessary to conspire to doubt the facts because reviewing the official documentation there are flaws and inconsistencies that make you rethink the facts. In Wikipedia itself, the \u0026ldquo;Discussion\u0026rdquo; and English section is full of debate with ideas that differ from the official version.\nThis article tries to summarize the official version of the facts and argue a more realistic alternative point of view to understand the When, Where, What, What, How, Who and Why or When, Where, What, How, Who and Why. These facts represent a very strong drama for the society, that\u0026rsquo;s why I do it with all my respect for the victims and their relatives.\nOfficial version As of today in 2022, the major sources for information about the official version of the 9/11 attacks are Wikipedia (online encyclopedia) with detailed articles with hundreds of quotes and Archive.org (California online library) with a database of video recordings. In 2001, cell phones barely existed and did not have video cameras, but the media and some people recorded the fires and the cause of the explosions in the towers.\nThe official investigations of the events of September 11, established that the 9/11 attacks were of an Islamic terrosite nature with the hijacking of planes that ended up crashing into the U.S. world economic headquarters in New York (WTC), the headquarters of the Department of Defense (the Pentagon) and another plane bound for the Capitol (Washington DC) that managed to evade the hijackers and ended up losing control crashing in an open field in Shakesville.\nOfficial event On Tuesday, September 11, 2001 between 8:46 - 10:28 a series of attacks took place which became known as 9/11 or 9/11. On that day the DoD (Department of Defense) had planned a series of military exercises to simulate an air raid on New York.\nThe sites affected by the attack were:\nWTC (World Trace Center) in Manhattan, New York. The Pentagon (DoD (Department of Defense) Center) located in Arlington, Virginia, suffered structural damage to the West ring of the building. United Airlines plane 93, crashes in the Shanksville, Pennsylvania wasteland. The three sites affected during 9/11 are located in the eastern United States. Arlington (Virginia) and Washington D.C. are very close to each other at 9 km distance separated by the Potomac River, while New York is north of them at 370 km distance.\nPlaces affected (context) Pentagon The Pentagon is the logistics center of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), built between September 11, 1941 and January 15, 1943. It is home to the FBI and CIA.\nWTC The World Trade Center (WTC) was the most important economic center in the world at the time, located in Manhattan (New York, United States). The financial complex was composed of:\nTwin Towers: tallest skyscrapers in the world until their collapse on 9/11. WTC 1 (north tower) with 110 floors and 410 meters high. A 110-meter-tall telecommunications antenna was added in 1978. WTC 2 (south tower) with 110 floors and 410 meters high. WTC 3 or Marriott World Trade Center. A 22-story hotel with 825 rooms, it connected the North Tower (WTC 1) with the South Tower (WTC 2). WTC 4 WTC 5 WTC 6 WTC 7 The complex had suffered three attacks in the course of history, before the total collapse. On a typical day, 50,000 people were working with more than 430 companies involved. Construction (1965 - 1973) Builder: Minoru Yamasaki, Emery Roth \u0026amp; Sons Financed by the Rockefeller family, similar in style to the Rockefeller Center buildings in midtown Manhattan spaced just 6 km apart in a straight line. The grandson of Standard Oil founder John D. Rockefeller, David Rockefeller decided to revive the WTC concept as the core of revitalized lower Manhattan. In May 1959, Rockefeller formed the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association, invested $250 million near the Fish Market on the East River, including a single tower with 70 stores and several smaller buildings. Reconstruction (2001 - 2013) 2. Rebuild: Larry Silverstein (Silverstein Properties), Daniel Libeskind (both Jewish). New complex includes: One World Trade Center, a high-rise building being planned at World Trade Center 2, World Trade Center 3, World Trade Center 4, World Trade Center 7, and another office building. Private actions Between 1998 - 2001 the WTC was privatized. A few months before the event, the lease of the World Trade Center was sold to Larry Silverstein along with GMAC Commercial Mortgage (a subsidiary of General Motors), Westfield America Inc and real estate investor Lloyd Goldman. Silverstein took out insurance that \u0026ldquo;fortuitously\u0026rdquo; covered terrorism. After 9/11, Silverstein took the insurance company to court, claiming they should pay him double because there were two attacks. He won and was awarded $4,550,000,000.

Game 11 was the decisive point in the chess match, Gasparov vs. Anand, which Gasparov won. In 1983 Dan Goodwin a.k.a. SpiderDan, the SkyscraperMan, climbed the North Tower before its fall. Philippe Petit crosses the WTC 1 and WTC towers by means of a thin cable while balancing. Previous attacks 13 February 1975, fire of 3 alarms on the 11th floor, spread by telephone cable to 5 more floors (2 below and 3 above). 26 February 1993, bomb attack (680 kg of explosives, Pakistani terrorsite). January 14, 1998, bank robbery (1.6 million, Brink\u0026rsquo;s armored truck to deliver the money by elevator to the 11th floor of WTC 1. How did it happen? Terrosite attack with airplanes According to the official version, 19 terrorists from the al-Qaeda terrorist group (in 4 distributed groups) hijack 4 commercial airliners and crash them with the aim of causing major structural and human damage to prominent U.S. buildings.\nAmerican Airlines Flight 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_11) a Boeing 767 departs Boston (Logan International Airport) for Los Angeles International Airport, but crashes into WTC 1 (north tower). United Airlines Flight 175](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_175) a Boeing 767 departs Boston (Logan International Airport) for Los Angeles International Airport, but crashes into WTC 2 (south tower). American Airlines Flight 77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_77) a Boeing 757 departs Washington Dulles International Airport (Virginia) and crashes into the West Wing of the Pentagon. United Airlines Flight 93](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93) a Boeing 757 departs Newark International Airport (New Jersey) for San Francisco (California). It was supposedly intended to be crashed into the Capitol but the crew managed to reduce the assailants and the plane ended up crashing in an open field in Stonycreek, Pennsylvania. Route of the planes according to the official version.\nFacts in chronological order At 08:46:40 American Airlines 11 crashes into the north facade of WTC 1 causing an explosion between the 93rd and 99th floors. After 102 min, at 10:28 it collapses. At 09:02:54 United Airlines Flight 175 crashes into the south facade of WTC 2 causing an explosion between the 77th and 85th floors. After 56 minutes, at 09:59 it collapses. At 09:37 American Airlines 77 crashes into the West side of the Pentagon. At 10:03 United Airlines Flight 93 crashes in Stonycreek Township, Pennsylvania. At 10:30 George Bush issues a statement of terrorist attack caused by airplanes. At 17:21 WTC 7 collapses in its entirety in 1 minute, 6 hours and 54 minutes after the second building collapse, WTC 1. FEMA version\nThe alleged crash of the plane into the Pentagon according to the official version.\nData WTC 1, WTC 2, WTC 3 (Marriott WTC) and WTC 7 collapse completely, the remaining three buildings (WTC 4, WTC 5, WTC 6) were damaged and subsequently demolished. The Deutsche Bank building closes after 9/11 due to radioactive contamination of the site, during the following months high radiation levels are recorded. NIST estimated about 17,400 people were in the WTC that day, yet only 2,753 deaths were certified. The attacks caused 2,977 fatalities, more than 25,000 injuries and considerable long-term health consequences, in addition to at least $10 billion in infrastructure and property damage. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, suspicion quickly fell on Al Qaeda and its leader Bin Laden. The United States formally responded by launching the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, who had not complied with U.S. demands to expel Al Qaeda from Afghanistan and extradite their leader Bin Laden. Officially the attacks were organized by the Islamic terrorist gang Al-Qaeda, which was in charge of hijacking the planes and crashing them. Their alleged motives were due to: U.S. support for Israel Support for \u0026ldquo;anti-Muslim attacks\u0026rdquo; in Somalia Support for the Philippines against Muslims in the Moro conflict Support for Israeli \u0026ldquo;aggression\u0026rdquo; against Muslims in Lebanon Support for Russia\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;atrocities against Muslims\u0026rdquo; in Chechnya Support for pro-U.S. governments in the Middle East (who \u0026ldquo;act as their agents\u0026rdquo;) against Muslim interests Support for India\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;oppression against Muslims\u0026rdquo; in Kashmir The presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia Sanctions against Iraq Alternative version Inconsistencies In the official version there are many incongruities and coincidences that raise doubts.\nOn September 10, 11 and 12, 2001 the Department of Defense (DoD) had planned a series of military exercises over New York City simulating an air raid, a situation that caused great confusion at the actual time of the attack. The previous days New York City suffered a 36-hour power outage. In addition, all WTC personnel along with the CIA, nSA and FBI were relocated to other offices. The version of the plane crash at WTC does not fit: The Empire State had suffered in 1945 the impact of a B-25 bomber plane and did not collapse. Sabotaging the cockpit of an airplane, with only the contents of the cockpit, is complicated due to the security doors. The F16 stealth planes did not go to intercept the hijacked airliners despite deviating from the route. Donald Rumsfeld, DoD Secretary, denied the takeoff order. If the planes had been hijacked from the beginning why did they make a detour to attack the towers and did not go directly. To hit two planes at low altitude at that speed is very complicated. There were no remains of the black boxes of the planes, nor the fuselage of these. There are videos that show explosions on the floors without plane crashes and there are people who affirm it. The videos that show a plane crash show that the plane goes through the building and then breaks the structure. And in the alleged photographs the plane is completely black with no shades of light. No passengers were identified from the plane nor any remains of them, however the IDs of the eight terrorists were found in good condition allowing them to be identified. A newscast tells the news of the fall of WTC 7 before its collapse with live images of the building standing. Shortly after, there is a cut in the transmission, with loss of the green image typical of explosions. WTC 7 collapsed 7 hours later and did not suffer any collision of artifacts. According to the official version, it collapsed due to fires in the base. No building in history has ever collapsed due to fire risk, let alone in 6 seconds. Frank A. DeMartini, manager of the construction of the WTC, assured in a documentary of the \u0026ldquo;History\u0026rdquo; channel recorded in January 2001 that: \u0026ldquo;The towers were structurally designed for the collision of 707 airplanes, the largest at that time\u0026rdquo;. The fall of the towers WTC1 and WTC2, is completely vertical starting from the base, if it were due to the weight of the airplanes they would fall from top to bottom and it was not the case. The firemen who were helping heard a loud noise before the collapse of the building. Buildings that have been shot at by missiles break into pieces and fall in the direction of the missile. The size caused in the explosions of the building does not correspond to that of the airplanes, since it has greater amplitude and does not present the form of the airplanes. The crash of a plane into the Pentagon does not fit either: The size of the gap generated by the impacted object does not correspond to the shape of an airplane. An airplane can\u0026rsquo;t fly at ground level that fast. The intermediate frames of the video of the object hitting the Pentagon were deleted. Senior personnel did not show up for work that day, including senior managers. The NSA, FBI and CIA were given the day off. Far fewer people than expected came to work at the WTC offices despite it being a Tuesday. Money at stake: 300 billion dollars worth of gold, silver and other precious metals were removed from underneath the WTC basement. Several entities and groups took advantage of the fall in the stock market to gain multi-million dollar shares. The Silversteins insured WTC1 and WTC2 for risk of terrorist attack months before the event, and took the insurer to court because they only contemplated one attack and not one for each tower, won the trial and doubled their value to $4.55 billion. Witnesses: Witnessed bombs exploding in the buildings. 2. 2. Firefighters heard the sound of an explosion before the buildings collapsed. Independent investigations and testimonies: The former president stated that it could only have been provoked by the explosion of bombs. 2. Jet fuel (kerosene) can at best burn at 1700ºF and 2950ºF as in the towers, many scientists claim that military explosive could have been used to melt the steel bases. Among them, Physicist Steven Jones claims that the WTC7 building and the Twin Towers were brought down not only by fire and damage resulting from the impact, but by cutting explosives installed in advance at the base of the buildings. He considered official reports from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the 9/11 Commission that the fires coupled with impact damage alone caused the complete toppling of the three buildings. And I present evidence for the controlled demolition hypothesis, suggested by the available data, which can be tested. Morgan Reynolds, a former advisor and economic advisor to the George W. Bush administration during his first term (now professor emeritus of economics at Texas A\u0026amp;M University), declared that the government\u0026rsquo;s story is \u0026ldquo;bogus\u0026rdquo; and that the incident was artificially created. In a June 13, 2005 article in the Washington Times, Reynolds said, \u0026ldquo;It is impossible to deny the existence of the scientific debate surrounding the real causes of the collapse of the Twin Towers and Tower 7. Only a professional, controlled demolition can explain all the elements proven in the investigation into the collapse of the three buildings.\u0026rdquo; No plane crashed in the Pentagon, but a missile exploded, this was supported by a statement made by Donald Rumsfeld himself in an interview to a press media, something that it was thought he would never admit. The attacks served as an excuse for: The fight against terrorism and the increase of security measures at all levels. The war against Afghanistan, the war against the Middle East and the search and capture of Osama Bin Laden (member of al-Qaeda). Gaining control of oil in the Middle East. Justification for attacking Afghanistan, creating wars, imposing new measures and changing the world economy. The 9/11 documentaries and films reinforce the idea of revenge, fight terrorism by focusing on hatred towards Islamic terrorists.\tAnd invest more in armaments and in the military sector. The plane enters without breaking the structure and then you see the explosion. Moreover, depending on the video it looks more realistic or more fake, and even in some of them you can only see the explosion without the impact of the plane. Your browser does not support the video tag. Compilation of videos of the crash of United Airlines Flight 175 into the south facade of WTC 2.\nIt is very likely that they edited the video and distributed it. For comparison in the Hollywood movie \u0026ldquo;Troy\u0026rdquo; (2003) the scene where Achilles stabs Boagrius in the neck with a dagger looks much more realistic. Your browser does not support the video tag. Clip Achilles vs Boagrius, Troy All these incongruities and coincidences show that the official version is false, it contains true elements but has several falsified facts to hide the real perpetrators and to point out an enemy to take advantage of.\nAnother important point is that from the first moment there was an impetus and way of acting on the part of the press and politics focused on revenge and capture of the attackers, instead of avoiding confrontation and trying to seek peace and restore order. It was already practicing it before with media programming (movies, series, news). The motives of the al-Qaeda group do not really carry much weight if compared to a premeditated attack by groups and lodges that made a great profit from it. These groups in turn would be hidden in the shadows and as long as there was no suspicion no one would be able to expose them.\nWhat really happened? The place and the sites affected are real, what is not certain is how it happened and who was behind it.\nThe towers did not collapse perfectly vertically by the collision of two planes, it is impossible that one plane brought down the structure of WTC 1 and then another WTC 2. \u0026ldquo;The steel structure of the towers was designed for the collision of Boeing 707 planes (the largest at the time)\u0026rdquo; said by the tenants themselves, physical simulations go against a possible structural collapse by the collision of planes. Now, if it is true that there were explosions, they were most likely installed bombs or devices dropped from outside, one article points to shots from the Woolworth building, while at the base controlled explosives were used, with nano-thermite bombs that melted and cut the steel columns in seconds.\nThe plane crash I rule out for several reasons:\nmany witnesses saw the explosion and saw no aircraft impact. The videos shown are not proof of it, as they look quite fake, they can be manipulated and there are other videos recorded of the same explosion where there is no plane impacting. There are no airplane fuselage remains in the WTC, there are no remains of the black boxes. The routes traveled by the planes having been hijacked from the beginning is to turn backwards, which does not make sense since it takes much longer. Maybe that point was to make landings and then follow the route in some way. Regarding the Pentagon attack it was not a plane either, this one simpler to understand. Here there is only one video available, which deleted the intermediate frames where the object was seen moving. Again there is no debris from the plane and the gap generated does not fit with a Boeing 757. It was a missile, this was acknowledged by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in a press question and Army Commander Albert Stubblebine said it was a missile and the explosions of the twin towers by controlled explosives.\nNow what happened to the four passenger planes that were allegedly hijacked and died crashing is more complex. There are several hypotheses here:\nThe planes take the normal route and landed earlier at a point where: their identification is changed or they are destroyed. Then a false signal is sent from the plane or else the radar is manipulated to the point of the attack. Passengers: They are either pre-selected to change their lives or are eliminated. The \u0026ldquo;terrorists\u0026rdquo; in charge of hijacking the plane were paid actors who would later remain alive. The plane crash in Pennsylvania, it is more difficult to know if it actually crashed or not. The people in the area did not hear any impact and it was not corroborated hours later. That plane was supposedly a terrorist attack on the Capitol in Washington D.C., the perfect cover for thinking that no high-ranking U.S. politicians could have been involved because it would have affected them.\nWho was behind it? The best way to sneak around and hide as the perpetrator is to blame others so you don\u0026rsquo;t get caught. Knowing that the official version makes no sense because of all the physical and logical inconsistencies, it shows that who is behind the support of these investigations are those who want to hide the information. The real perpetrators were the deep state, powerful families, high political officials, sectors of the NSA, the CIA, the FBI, Masonic lodges (specifically Judeo-Masons) and Zionists. The security agencies of several countries were also involved, including England (MI6), Israel (Mossad) and Saudi Arabia. The point is that it was organized in advance from the top.\nThe 9/11 attacks were a false flag attack (inside job) with multiple targets. Bin Laden and AlQaeda were actors who even had relationships with American politicians like the Clintons, Obama, Bush, there are pictures of friendship in the past. It was an attack organized from the Deep State, they had it planned from the date of its creation.\nThe fact that it was organized for a long time, even planned since its construction we can see it in the predictive programming of the media used as a negative primate to slow down the learning process in the audience and condition it.\nWhy did they do it? The why of the events is the hardest question and the one that has the most value. Why would anyone do harm to others even to their own people, for what purpose. A group of terrorists with box cutters and aircraft piloting skills is not capable of making a seamless attack let alone with the motives mentioned, as it was suicide.\nBy means of a false flag attack, the shadowy perpetrators can justify any recrimination:\nIt allows to change the world economy and politics. It allows to invest much more money in the military sector to fight \u0026ldquo;terrorism\u0026rdquo; and justify wars like the one in the Middle East. It allows invading territories and stealing oil in the countries causing \u0026ldquo;terrorism\u0026rdquo;. It allows to subdue the population through fear to make it more moldable and controllable. It allows to channel the energy of general thought to focus it on an idea. Allows for greater power and control. False flag attacks The United States is already known for its false flag attacks, throughout history it has used it several times as a pretext and justification for wars or a specific purpose.\nExplosion of the battleship Maine (own ship) by the United States to declare war on Spain and invade Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Attack of Pearl Harbor, the ships were not notified of a Japanese invasion. With this pretext they could drop bombs on the civilian population of Japan and thus demand its surrender. Sinking of the Titanic, several families were on board the ship to vote on the creation of the Federal Reserve, those who were in favor of its creation never set sail while the families who opposed it died at sea. This allowed the creation of the Federal Reserve by majority vote, which was used years later to finance both sides of World War I and World War II. In addition to money laundering and control. They seek war because they seek the desire to control, to conquer, to impose and thus gain more power. The objective is an energetic control is to channel the emanated energy and nourish themselves with it. If there is no one to invade, they would not be so interested in invading.\nAnd those in charge of this role are a series of groups and lodges that seek that power and that in part they have it because of the way the system has been structured.\nThe groups that intervened are difficult to know with totality but one can count Freemasonry (in particular by Jews), the agencies of the American government (NSA, CIA, FBI) and the MOSSAB (Isreal\u0026rsquo;s agency), the Rockefeller family, the Bush family and the Silversteins and high positions of Washington\u0026rsquo;s politics.\nWithin the State bodies many would not support such a cause but like any pyramid system, the lower ranks need not know.\nProgramming Before the attack dozens of artists made warnings of an attack on September 1, 2001 at the WTC, either on albums like (Michael Jackson), in a live concert like Prince (Osam Bin Laden getting ready to bomb 2001. Let\u0026rsquo;s go!), a writer warned that Bin Laden would be blamed months before the attacks, the singer of Oasis and much more that I have not mentioned.\nAnd hundreds of media, including comics, series, movies, cartoons, showed the fall of the towers and the plane bombing long before September 11, 2001, as a method of programming.\nSoon skyscraper on fire.\nA strip on a bridge in \u0026ldquo;Terminator\u0026rdquo; reads danger 9-11.\nA Marvel comic book features the twin towers cut with the Nazi flag.\nThe card of Neo protagonist of the Matrix, expires on September 11, 2001.\nThe Simpsons put on a magazine cover that reads New York 9 11 (eleven formed by the twin towers) and the money symbol (dollar). The magazine costs $9 dollars but the towers are purposely placed forming an 11.\nMichael Jackson\u0026rsquo;s cover explains the whole 9-11 bombing in New York. Michael marks 9:11 on an imaginary clock, he dances on top of a black and white checkered floor (of Freemasonry), in the background there is an explosion and WTC 1 is gone. She is dressed in blood red and there is a crescent moon as on September 1, 2001, referring to the sacrifice. He also wears a mourning on his right arm raised.\nHere I leave video compilation of predictive programs in the media, about 140 appearances refer to the twin towers and the pentagon with 9-11 being demolished with gunfire, bombs, planes, narratives of why they did it and with direct references to Freemasonry. After the attacks, much of the information containing references to 9/11 was removed because it was sensitive to the victims. In addition, censorship was applied to anyone who tried to seriously expose the facts and anyone who disagreed with the official version was ridiculed.\nSymbology When you study symbology you realize the power of numerology, astrology and the value these occult lodges place on it to perform their acts.\nFreemasonry The $5, $10, $20, $20, $50 and $100 bill folded just forms a building that goes from being on fire to being completely demolished, like WTC1 and WTC2. The creation of the dollar and banknotes has a lot to do with the creation of the United States and Freemasonry. The one dollar bill (the unit), features George Washington a prominent Freemason known as the founder of the United States and on its reverse side appears the Illiminati triangle and more encrypted symbology.\nThe arch of Washington Square gave a glimpse of the twin towers in the background. The cities are built in a grid pattern and many of them have a lot of Masonic symbolism with relationships of distances, shapes and geometries between important buildings. Washington, capital of the United States and a city with a lot of Masonic symbolism, its streets form drawings from the aerial view with a multitude of encrypted meanings.\nGematria: The power of 11 The 11 represents the Illuminati pyramid, it is the main symbol of the Illuminati, a number that multiplied by itself (11x11=121) forms an ascending and descending ladder of numbers, Pascal\u0026rsquo;s triangle fulfills the property of $11^n$ and by adding both sides of the multiplication the pyramid is preserved.\nDate: September 11 September 11 is a day of high Masonic ritualistic charge. In pure numerology there would be 111 days left until the end of the year. These are very important dates (War of Succession / Diada), the overthrow of Allende and the beginning of the dictatorship in Chile, the day the first single of the Beatles was recorded, the lifting of the iron curtain in Germany, the USSR withdraws troops from Cuba, countless \u0026ldquo;meetings\u0026rdquo; and meetings of presidents, etc.. Attacks on the 11th 9/11 - Attacks in New York and Arlington, USA. 11M - False flag bombing in Madrid, Spain. 11M - U.S. dropping of \u0026ldquo;atomic\u0026rdquo; bombs on Fukushima and Ngasaki, Japan. Conclusion The version that each one wants to accept is a personal fact, the important thing is to be aware of it, to have one\u0026rsquo;s own opinion and not to be carried away by fear, which is what a terrorist or deep state side is looking for. Nor should we act in a vindictive way because then we will increase the problem and give the result they are looking for, violence and chaos to impose their order.\nThe official version is made to make us ignorant and hide information from hidden powers acting in the shadows. You may not want to accept an alternative version for fear of thinking that this reality exists, but it is better to know it because then you have room for action and correction to create a better world.\nReferences Wikipedia (official version) September 11 attacks WTC 1973 - 2001 WTC 2001 - present History WTC September 11 Collection - Archive.org Understanding 9/11 - Archive.org Collapse of World Trade Center Snopes (fact checker) - WTC terrorism insurance https://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/09/22/rec.buried.treasure/index.html Alternative version Bibliotecapleyades - WTC 11S - Human Progressivism 11S - Awakenings.org Investigate11s Jim Do Free 911 Primate twin towers | Awakenings.org False flag 911 | Counter currents 360 FAq to were the Twin Towers designed to wtihstand the impact of the airplanes 9/11 conspiracy theories ","permalink":"https://curiosity432.xyz/posts/911-explanation/","summary":"Intro September 11, 2001 is remembered as the biggest terrorist attack in the recent history of the 21st century, which caused a worldwide commotion and changed the economy of all countries since it occurred in Manhattan, New York in the offices of the economic center of the United States and the world.

When it comes to classifying information we do the same whether in a physical environment with a folio or a digital one with an electronic device. In a physical environment to classify information we write in notebooks, notepads, blackboards; while in a digital environment we need tools that adapt.\nTo digitally organize the information that abounds and sometimes exceeds, it is essential to follow a good method of categorization or workflow and have the necessary tools to facilitate the process. In this way we will achieve an orderly system that is easier to consult and study, even for people who know the subject.\nThe categorization method is a personal matter, but the software used is universal for everyone. This type of software focused on file organization is called managers. Depending on the use there are several types, in this article we will mention the most relevant ones.\nBackup manager Backup managers are essential to keep files synchronized between devices and storage sources. In order to avoid file loss and keep devices up to date.\nFreeFileSync. One of the best folder comparison and synchronization software (cross-platform, open-source and free) for creating and managing file backups. Duplicati.

Speed, trim and pitch editing. Documents. Plain text editing. Image. Contrast, brightness, saturation, shadows and color editing. Videos. Editing of audio + image values. The \u0026ldquo;ideal\u0026rdquo; manager would be a mix of: Eagle.cool for the file display, interface and group tagging. Windows Explorer or Files for its filtering and organization options. Obsdian.md for its graph viewer, customizable interface and compatible plugins. TagSpaces for its geotagging, allowing to keep the folder structure. My favorite to date is Eagle.cool but the problem is that it does not allow to open all files internally (although for that there are editors) and its storage is in a library of the program itself with a folder per file with (name.xyz + name_minuature.xyz + name.json) which makes the file transfer much slower by the number of folders created. Another point against it is that it only allows two devices with Windows or Mac registry. Another very useful manager is Files, the modern and open-source version of the well-known Windows explorer, with color labeling, multi-window and a variety of themes. The bad thing is that it is only for Windows, the view of folders is hierarchical and the labeling is basic without grouping or the possibility of exporting.\nAs a fact to add metadata to the files an external database is needed, since normally the files according to the format come with their own metadata limit. This makes it necessary to add files with extra information (info-extra.json) and the folder structure changes. One way to preserve the directory structure is to add the metadata in the file name but this is a limited method.\nConclusion The software used to manage files is a good tool to classify information and facilitate the work of collecting and learning. But at the end of the day what matters is the objective you want to achieve with these data, you can vary the method until you find the one you like the most or the one you are most comfortable with.\nReferences Apps for organize content - AlternativeTo Synchronise Your Offline Notes Across All Devices Without the Cloud What\u0026rsquo;s the Best Software for Tagging Files?

Here you can see the code to solve the math problem with python. You can compile online (online-python.com) or local with python installed.\n1. Pythagorean Theorem with observer height Pythagorean Theorem: $$a²+b²=c² \\Rightarrow c=\\sqrt{a²+b²}$$\nWhere (a=d1, b=R, c=R+h0): $$d_1^2+R^2=(R+h_0)^2 \\Rightarrow d_1=\\sqrt{(R+h_0)²-R²}=\\sqrt{h_0^2+2Rh_0}$$\nAnd also a=d2, b=R, c=R+h1, para d=d1+d2 -\u0026gt; d2=d-d1 $$d_2^2+R^2=(R+h_1)^2 \\Rightarrow h_1=\\sqrt{d_2^2-2Rh_1}=\\sqrt{(d-d_1)^2-2Rh_1}$$\nMathematical function of the curvature for a sphere of R=6371 km above the surface.

Example: if the observer and object are separated at the shore of a lake at 200 m of altitude, ## the height is the same along all the distance and is not at sea level, so would be hR = 0.2 Km. (Default hR = 0, sea level) # User data in same unit (Km) d = 30 h0 = 0.01 # h0 = 0.01 Km = 10 m hR = 0 R = 6371 + hR # Pythagorean theorem: # d2 = d - d1, (R+h0)^2=d1^2+R^2 and (R+h1)^2=d2^2+R^2 d1 = sqrt(h0**2+(2*R*h0)) h1 = sqrt((d-d1)**2+R**2)-R print(\u0026#34;The distance to the geometrical horizon is %.3f Km and the hidden height is %.3f Km\u0026#34; % (d1, h1)) 2.

For very high heights the calculations by Pythagoras are not so correct and the second (negative) result of the square root appears. In addition it must be taken into account that in the spherical model nothing could be seen beyond the distance of the radius, since the visible face of the sphere is at most an angle of 90º from the vertical.\nReferences: Online calculators Advanced Earth Curvature Calculator Earth Curve Calculator Make Panorama ","permalink":"https://curiosity432.xyz/posts/sphere-curvature-calc/","summary":"Sphere curvature calculator Scheme Ángulos: α: angle variation $\\overline{\\rm A_0 B_0}$. α1: angle variation$\\overline{\\rm A_0 G_0}$. α2: angle variation $\\overline{\\rm G_0 B_0}$.

A Pa and a Jo talking.\nJo - If there are only 100 people in the world and they all think alike, that is, there is only one opinion, does that mean that there is only one truth, that there are more and they don\u0026rsquo;t know them or that they are wrong and don\u0026rsquo;t know it? Is truth a matter of being, exernal or the idea of a group of individuals? Is truth what is established, what is said, what is invented, what is created, what exists or what is?\nPa - As far as I know, the number of people does not determine whether something is true or false, what it does determine is the power of that idea in society. Besides, if there is only one idea, there can only be one truth and anything that deviates from it will be considered a lie. Therefore it has a lot of power since it classifies the rest of ideas and is established above all. However, this does not make it true, besides, if there is no debate of ideas, no sharing, they will never leave that state and they will not be able to discover or consider something new, so everything will remain static in that apparent static truth. If there is one thing certain it is that we are all different and that each one perceives the world in his own way, influenced by the rest and by his individuality (body, mind and soul). Everything is changeable, everything is relative and there is nothing immutable, which by self-definition also implies that there can be something stable because the definition itself is changeable and relative. When we speak of truth, we unconsciously deal with several layers of truth, the first of all is the individual layer, the one that belongs to the I am, to the being. From here would come the question of what is being, is it the same as being? It is not the same to be seen from me as from the eyes of another person, am I what I say, what I do, what I contemplate, what I think, what I see, what I desire, what I hate, am I all that, am I much more or am I much less? From the most objective point of view possible, the being is far beyond the body, the clothes, the objects, the being would be the thoughts, what we would call your true essence, that which losing everything you would continue to maintain.\nJo: But how do I know that what you say is true if it is your point of view? Is it only true what everyone thinks? What if you are wrong? What if you think you are right? Is there any truth outside each one of us? If we do not exist, would truth still exist? If I know nothing and I want to learn to understand what is truth and what is lie, how do I do it? Am I born learned or do I remember the knowledge? If truth is relative then what is the use of science, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be easier to create truths in reality and establish them as unique to reach the truth? Do scientists act to understand what is reality or are they influenced / indoctrinated by their studies and what they mark creating realities marked by those who determine what is and what is not to be studied?\nPa: Slow down, young man, you won\u0026rsquo;t understand everything in one day. We act guided by our feelings rather than by our mind, and based on that we make decisions. With it we establish bonds of trust with other people or groups of people, and these together with many other techniques make us trust and believe in the person. In general, the bonds of trust range from close family relationships, friends, teachers, acquaintances and then the people to whom we assign power for their work. That is to say, every worker who contributes something to society, a judge, a policeman, a doctor, a nurse, each job has a role in society and it is usually specific. By this I mean that if people go to the doctor it is usually because they want a solution to their physical problem and it is because they trust him. If people buy bread from the baker it is because they like it, they need it, and it presents some convenience. If bread were unnecessary, very expensive and tasted bad almost nobody would buy bread because it would be a waste of money, I don\u0026rsquo;t say nobody because you don\u0026rsquo;t know for sure how most people will act. In terms of the baker, the taste of bread is a relative thing, it is not a truth, there are people who will like it, others who will not and others who will not get the taste. The same thing happens with the price of bread, for some people it will be cheap and for others it will not, depending on what they are used to pay and the money they have. So here it is quite understandable that it is a relative truth or even that there is truth in these matters. However, there are things that are more important, if a person is allergic to gluten, the baker should know if the bread contains gluten or not. He must know the baking times for the bread to be good, but for that he must assume that the time of the clocks is always the same, that they are not delayed and that they do not spoil. How does he know if the clocks count right if to measure the clocks he needs another clock, if everything is relative how can he be sure. In this case the baker could not give more thought to the matter and simply wait or check that the bread does not burn, but if a machine does it, all these parameters should be stable so that the differences between one loaf and another are minimal. Maybe the issue of the clocks getting out of sync is a little out of whack, but you can\u0026rsquo;t be sure that this will happen. That\u0026rsquo;s why you have to adapt to each situation and set a reference system for each one. The issue comes when you establish one idea as unique and the rest as false, when you do that you are imposing an idea. It is turning a relative truth or an invented story into a joint reality. That is why we must leave room for doubt and be open to questioning and questioning things. As long as it works well, go ahead and if you find some mistake, try to correct it.\nJo - But if people are used to this system and think they are living well, they don\u0026rsquo;t have enough knowledge to ask themselves a very complex, technical and specific question. How do they know that they are not wrong? How do they know that what they are doing is correct or true?\nPa - There comes a point when that will happen, that\u0026rsquo;s why you have to try to respect and not hurt others, follow the rule of don\u0026rsquo;t do to others what you don\u0026rsquo;t want them to do to you. And understand that we can be wrong and that it is better to fix the mistake ahead of time than to hide it or forget about it.\nJo - Any conclusions from all this?\nPa - Well, that we should not impose on the rest, if you want to understand this world, that everyone will have their own process of understanding things. And that everyone who wants to investigate, do it for him and to help others, not because it is so established. We create our reality but we can also grasp it without being influenced by external agents. The truth is usually associated with the objective, but by the fact of being individual beings the objective does not exist, however as a whole if there are common ideas for all what we call more shared ideas or reality.\n","permalink":"https://curiosity432.xyz/posts/the-truth/","summary":"What is the truth?

Based on this I asked myself the following question: how many common relatives of the eleventh generation did I have?\nTo get the result I thought if the first generation we have 2 parents, the second 4 grandparents, the third 8 great-grandparents, the fourth 16 great-great-grandparents and so on. The number of members of each generation is double the previous one, it follows a serial pattern expressed with the equation: $Y = 2^n$, where Y: is the number of members of each generation n: is the number of the generation, $n \\in N$.\nThen for generation 11 (n=11) I already had the result $Y=2^{11}=2048$. A total of 2048 relatives of that generation. Like the game \u0026ldquo;2048\u0026rdquo;, which is to iterate 11 times the sum of deuces up to 2048 in puzzle without crashing. But a bigger question arose for me and how many relatives I had a thousand or two thousand years ago, since that case was for 4 centuries ago.\nExplanation $Y = 2^n$ is a fairly common exponential equation in nature because most things follow a di-vision (double vision). Cell division follows this growth where n represents the times the original cell or generation has divided. In the case of cells multiplying and dividing is the same, it is doubling their quantity.\nThe equation $Y=2^n$ has a very fast growth as you constantly double the number of people or add the same result over and over again.\nIt is famous the saying \u0026ldquo;If you fold a leaf over itself 42 times you would reach the distance from here to the Moon\u0026rdquo;, considering the official distance of a Moon at 360 000 km on average with respect to the Earth. This fact is based on doubling the result in each iteration, because when you fold a sheet in half the thickness becomes double in each fold. Physically it is impossible because after 14 folds you can not continue folding a sheet on itself and its width becomes very narrow. However, at a mathematical level it is possible to perform the equation and obtain a result. Taking into account that a sheet measures $0.1 mm = 1 \\cdot 10^{-6} Km$ of thickness and that in each fold the thickness doubles, it is obtained that for 42 folds it exceeds 400 thousand kilometers: $2^{42} \\cdot 10^{-6} = 439804.65 Km$.\nApplying the equation With this equation applied to a family tree we can travel to the \u0026ldquo;past\u0026rdquo; and calculate the number of people in each generation of our common ancestral family.\nTo do this we start with the following assumption:\nAll ancestors had a child at 33 years of age on average, i.e. 3 generations per century (every 100 years), therefore 30 generations per millennium (1000 years). These generations coincided living at the same time at least in a period of time. With grandparents it is easy to think, now as we go backwards the differences between the age at which children are had in the different generations can vary a lot. So it is difficult to know if they coincided living at the same time. All parents are independent (each man has a child with only one woman). This fact is the most complicated to be fulfilled, a man can have children with several women and a woman can have children with several men (although usually the other way around). It is difficult to make the calculation since the life expectancy was lower in the past and the relatives of that ancestral generation do not have to have coincided in life. Besides, families can be mixed, but let\u0026rsquo;s continue.\nCalculation This case is based on only children, not counting siblings, only from one family and with parents at age 33. This means that the numbers applied to the world population could be much higher.\nWith what was considered before, 1000 years ago corresponds to 30 generations (n=30). Applied to the equation we get the number of relatives of Generation 30: $Y=2^{30}=1.073.741.824$\nAccording to Wikipedia data the total population in the year 1000 was around 310 million, 3 times smaller than the calculations made with 1 billion Gen-30 relatives. The data for the 33rd generation of my family tree is greater than the total population of The Earth at that time, yes under those assumptions but that is only 1000 years ago and not considering the rest of humans.\nQuestions One of the questions is: why does the number of people grow into the past and not decrease, when the population is larger in the present? The answer is that it grows because it is only taking into account the ancestral family with respect to one child and not all the children of the planet.\nIt is understood that we all come from a common pair of human beings (Adam and Eve as cited in the Bible), by logic in the past we were less and towards the future the number of the population tends to increase.\nBut according to the extension of a family tree the ancestors follow the equation of $2^{n}$ in an increasing way up to a point from where the origin started. However, if we go back just one millennium, the data gets very out of order, when the official history places the ancient Egyptians in 3000 B.C. (about 5000 years ago). (about 5000 years ago). It is only necessary to look at our grandparents, they had a large family with at least 3 children and most of them before the age of 33.\nI have to say that two members (without being a couple) of the 11th generation do not have to share absolutely nothing of family at first, only the offspring. The kinship between great-grandparents on the mother\u0026rsquo;s and father\u0026rsquo;s side is almost nil.\nThere are many unknown factors for the calculation but making a low ball estimate the number of ancestors does not fit the population data in the past.\nAnswers The answers can be several:\nDead: People had a short life span, died very young and did not increase the population. Many dead at some time either due to pandemics / historical resets. Nataliad: There have been times with low birth rate. A few have had many children during an epoch or there is parental sharing. Beginning of the human species: We are not that long-lived as a species. The calculations may not be correct but they are an estimate at a minimum, taking into account only one family tree and the living people of that generation.\nBut I have more doubts, if we come from common parents call them what you will.\nWho created them? If it is by evolution it is still unanswered who created the beginning, if it is an external species more doubts arise and we do not come from chance. Chance, another superior being or God. How did they maintain their descendants? It had to be with incest if it was in a natural way and from there to increase the population with different families that diverge. At the present time Nowadays it is not even necessary to have a father to have offspring, since there is in vitro fertilization in a woman\u0026rsquo;s womb, the storage of gametes (male and female) and who knows if they have the technology to do it artificially, let\u0026rsquo;s hope not and that it is not carried out. With animals there have already been births in an artificial placenta.\nHowever, in the past such technology was not supposed to exist, so they were all parents who would mostly see their children being born, if the father did not die before and the mother got through the birth without complications.\nNature tends to make a balance between men and women but the population could survive only with women if they could guarantee the offspring somehow with in vitro sperm.\nAnd one of the main problems the elite/power groups have is that they know that the population numbers can skyrocket if life expectancy increases. They are afraid of losing power and not being able to control such a high number of people, and it is a problem for their status. That is why they warn and propagandize that natural resources are limited and can run out, that is why they define and delimit the extension of the planet\u0026rsquo;s territory. And that is why they resort to measures to reduce the number of the population, either by reducing the birth rate or by increasing the death rate.\nWhen we talk about pandemics, we refer to the greatest pandemic of this century, and what happened in previous centuries? Did they also occur in the 1920s?\nConclusion To change the world, you just need to change the minds of the coming generations for a period of about 100 years where you indoctrinate / educate the old, middle and young. And everyone who comes after will only know what they have been told or what they have access to through the records.\nThe power resides in each one of us, we all come from the same source and we all leave towards it. We are all united because we are part of the Whole.\nReferences How 1 Person Can Expose The Identities of 1000 The Problem With Our Ancestors - How Many Great Grandparents Does 1 Person Have? 13 folds: new world record in end-to-end paper folding How Many Times Can You Fold a Sheet of Paper World population The Garden of Earthly Delights - Hieronymus Bosch ","permalink":"https://curiosity432.xyz/posts/ancestor-problem/","summary":"A few months ago when I was doing my family tree I had a doubt about the common ancestors.

To answer this question let\u0026rsquo;s start by analyzing its etymology, the word \u0026ldquo;horizon\u0026rdquo; comes from the Ancient Greek ὁρίζων (horízōn, \u0026ldquo;definite boundary\u0026rdquo;) participle of the verb [ὁρίζω](https://en. wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BD%81%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%CE%B6%CF%89#Ancient_Greek \u0026ldquo;ὁρίζω\u0026rdquo;) (horízō, \u0026ldquo;to define, determine\u0026rdquo;) which comes from the noun ὅρος (hóros, \u0026ldquo;boundary\u0026rdquo;).\nTo observe the horizon a three-dimensional space is necessary, in higher physical dimensions it could also occur but with another geometry. It also requires a separation of media to observe it, in which the horizon forms the base that separates both media while the vertical would be the height, in the case of the earth the horizon separates the atmosphere from the land or sea surface.\nThe main point to understand the concept of horizon is that it is an optical phenomenon independent of the geometry of the surface, it is always a horizontal line that forms a circle around an observer, located at the same height for any distance and height. And it occurs due to the behavior of light in the medium in which we are immersed, usually air.\nLight always travels in a straight line and seeks the shortest optical path, i.e. the one that takes the least time to travel, which is why there are the phenomena of refraction and refraction, and convergent or divergent rays depending on the types of lenses.\nNow that we know that the horizon is conditioned by the behavior of the optics, let\u0026rsquo;s move on to the factors involved. They can be grouped into two: visibility of the environment (usually the atmosphere) and perspective.\nThe visibility depends on the environmental factors with their associated thermodynamic variables: the particles of the medium (number of moles (R)), the density of the medium (d=m/V, m: mass and V: volume), the electrostatic charge ($mu$), the temperature (T), the pressure (P); all of them intrinsically related. In addition, the angle of incidence of the light, the intensity and the illumination of the object have an influence. Atmospheric visibility is mainly reduced by: The concentration of particles in the air such as fog, haze, humidity, rain. The density of the air which decreases with altitude. The perspective is determined by the height with respect to the surface and the distance at which objects are observed on the horizon, as objects move away their size becomes smaller. The higher the height, the more distant objects can be observed because the field of view increases. In this VR case it looks somewhat curved because when creating the 360° video it stitches together the captures from several cameras and the circular view is stitched together.\nHow far is the horizon? The distance to the horizon is not fixed and varies according to the parameters mentioned above. The horizon cannot be reached because it is an optical phenomenon, what can be reached are the objects that are in front of it.\nNow the shape of the environment in which we are immersed modifies the distance to the horizon. For a spherical terrestrial model of 12 742 km in diameter, its maximum distance would be determined by the shape but it would still be an optical effect. Geometrically it would be impossible to observe from sea level any object (including Everest) beyond 336 km since the occultation of objects by curvature is 8858 meters greater than Everest.\nRegardless of the shape, atmospheric visibility has a limit that varies according to the factors mentioned above. At sea level the visibility normally does not exceed 100 km, this can be checked with islands that are separated at coast level about 100 km and some days are visible and others are not. The range of 30-60 Km is usually visible in normal conditions and in good conditions the visibility reaches up to 200-300 Km. For this to happen the air has to be very clean, the light has to hit the object at an angle that makes it focus (either at dawn or dusk) and the clouds act as a light screen with the reflection of the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays.\nIn reality there is no earth curvature, at sea level you can observe objects that should be hidden for several kilometers, more verifiable as we climb in height having more field of view and better visibility as objects can be observed that should be hidden for hundreds of kilometers.\nThere are many cases where objects that should be completely hidden, are visible from the base with less visibility in the lower areas due to the higher atmospheric density and clouds that usually cover the surface.\nThe curve cut-off at sea level depends on the altitude, here is a table as a scheme:\nAltitude Distance to the curvature cutoff 0.01 Km 3.56 Km 0.1 Km 35 Km 1 Km 112 Km 10 Km 357 Km 100 Km 1133 Km 1000 Km 3707 Km Example: photograph of El Teide (Tenerife) taken from Los Ajaches (Lanzarote) at 290 Km distance and 429 meters high. The curvature occultation would be 3663 meters and the Teide measures 3719 m, so only the highest 56 m would be visible. However, Teide is seen from 2000 meters and the lower part is covered by the sea of clouds and by visibility, not by a cut. In fact, comparing with another photo, it can be seen that the lower part of Tenerife is visible up to 1800 meters, and the rest is hidden by visibility.\nCalculation of curvature at 429 m altitude and 290 km distance\nReferences Perspective Horizon Python compiler Playlist of real Earth photos ","permalink":"https://curiosity432.xyz/posts/the-horizon/","summary":"Introduction.

From now on it will be cited as spherical or flat as appropriate.\nBrief description (shape, rotation, sky) Spherical: official version from the 15th to the 15th century. XV to s. XXI, planet inclined 23.4º with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The Earth has its own rotational motion around the Sun as it moves in the Solar System (Heliocentric model), with the Moon in asynchronous motion rotating around it. Flat: Flat round motionless round Earth. The Sun and Moon rotate at the top around the Earth (Geocentric model), forming the days and nights. Celestial Vault Verifiable from Earth Magnetic field\nSpherical: Circular from north pole to south pole, generated due to the inner core of the Earth. Plane: Toroidal, lines from north to south and from south to north. Curvature of the Earth\nSpherical: Curvature visible from 20 km. Ships, robots, probes have left the Earth and have photographed it. Astronauts and spacecraft have gone to the Moon. Space missions: ISS, Mars, probe lands on an asteroid (Rossetta), passed near Pluto. Plane: No curvature, curvature calculations are flawed. Photos at 30 km altitude by independent projects show a flat circular horizon. Does not exist, fake videos. Flat horizon, no one has exceeded 200 km altitude, no photos from space. The whole model is a recreation of aerial photos. The plans of the longest bridges and canals in the world do not take into account this effect. Distance to the stars\nSpherical: Stars in the sky look \u0026lsquo;chisporrotenates\u0026rsquo; due to the atmosphere that deflects the light. The light allows to measure distances and to know the composition of the stars. Plane: Observing the stars in the sky is like measuring a luminous object off the surface deep under water. And the fact that there are other spherical planets does not imply that the earth is spherical. Hemispheres\nSpherical: Northern hemisphere: \u0026ldquo;upper\u0026rdquo; of the sphere, farthest from the Sun. Southern hemisphere: \u0026ldquo;lower\u0026rdquo; sphere, coldest area of the planet, located Antarctica. Plane: Discrimination according to the lines of force of the magnetic field. There are no hemispheres but center and outside of the plane. Antarctica is the ice edge of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s circular plane. Antarctica has an average height of 3 km above sea level and the coldest temperatures on the planet. Nobody has crossed this frozen continent by any means, there are no photographs of aerial view, it does not belong to any country and since 1960 there is a treaty for the distribution of the area between countries and not allow the entrance to tourists. Horizon\nSpherical: Curved horizon from 20 km. The ISS is at 400 km altitude orbiting the Earth. The satellites also orbit. Flat: Images from aircraft at altitudes of 40 km show a flat horizon. NASA and other space agencies fake the videos or use fisheye effect to make the horizon curved. Flat horizon at any height and at the same position for the observer. The maximum distance to the horizon depends on air visibility and light refraction. It is possible to observe farther than the spherical model. Stations\nSpherical: Due to the 23.4º tilt of the Earth and the inclination of the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays. Due to the position of the Sun. Flat: There is no tilt, the angle formed on the normal for 23.4º is 66.6º, number of the devil chosen on purpose by the lodges. The Sun\nThe Sun Spherical: Star at the center of the Solar System, around which the rest of the planets revolve. Plane: Ball illuminates in a toroidal field, it does not have a fixed position. Analemma: the curve (lemniscata) that describes the position of the Sun in the sky if it is observed every day of the year at the same time of day (time zone) and from the same place of observation. Sun\u0026rsquo;s rays Spherical: As the light source is far away, the Sun is 150 million km away. The light rays are considered parallel. Flat: Sun rays are not parallel, depending on the position of the observer. The Sun is much closer than the spherical model. The Moon\nMoon rotated 180º (according to position on planet) Spherical: Depending on the observer in the hemisphere, it is rotated 180º. Flat: From the center it looks one way and as you move away towards the edges the visible part of the atmospheric dome changes and the moon rotates. Moon - Sun Spherical: The similar apparent size is a coincidence, the Sun is a star in the center separated at 150 000 000 Km while the Moon is a rocky satellite with craters at 330 00 Km. Plane: Same apparent size, like a perfect duality between day and night. It is no coincidence, if it were an expanding and constantly moving universe the sky should have changed. The Moon has its own light, it is composed of Krypton plasma which is luminous due to the high voltage at that altitude. Motion of the planet in the system.\nHeliocentrism: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune revolve around the Sun. Geocentrism: Earth in the center, Sun and Moon revolving around it. Motion.\nSpherical: The Earth has only one satellite, the Moon, which revolves around the Earth with asynchronous rotation (always shows the same face). The Earth revolves around the Sun (Heliocentrism), which revolves around the galaxy, which orbits around a cluster of galaxies of the Observable Universe in constant accelerated expansion caused by the Big Bang. The Sun revolves around the Earth (Geocentrism), the Moon always shows the same face. The Moon always shows the same face because it has only one face and it has its own light since it has the Sun in front of it and can be seen in the sky. Rotation of the Earth\nSpherical**: The Earth rotates around the Sun. The air rotates with the Earth at the same speed. Flat**: The Earth does not rotate, if it rotated according to the data of 300 km/s the airplanes would notice the forces when moving from one point to another, and the times would differ. The difference between aircraft times lies in the route taken and the air currents. Star rotation\nSpherical**: The explanation that stars rotate is due to the rotation of the Earth. The argument that the stars rotate in one direction in one hemisphere and in another direction in another hemisphere is not true, they rotate in both directions in the same \u0026lsquo;hemisphere\u0026rsquo;. The different rotation is simply due to which way you look at it. You can observe rotations in both directions in the same place. If you rotate an axle with two wheels forward, the left wheel rotates clockwise and the right wheel rotates counterclockwise. Data brought from outside the planet Represents a minority of data, obtained thanks to space missions outside the Earth.\nCelestial objects\nArtificial Spherical: satellites, Hubble, ISS. Satellites orbit around the Earth, ISS at 400 km altitude orbiting the Earth. Flat: there are no \u0026ldquo;orbiting satellites\u0026rdquo; they are hot air balloons, drones, zepellin that circle the sky. 95% of internet communications are by submarine cables. Natural Spherical**: celestial objects appear to be spherical. Flat: Earth orbit: Moon missions: Apollo (NASA), Rocosmos (USSR). Missions to other planets: NASA and other countries\u0026rsquo; missions are fake. Stars, galaxies, planets, black holes, comets, meteors. The celestial vault with constellations has not changed for millennia, the pattern has been repeated for as long as we know. If everything is in constant expansion, with rotations, including translations, why hasn\u0026rsquo;t it changed? Space missions Spherical: Missions to the Moon: Apollo (NASA), Rocosmos (USSR). Missions to other planets: near Pluto, Rossetta comets. Plane: NASA and other institutions falsify images by means of CGI. Photos of the Moon are flawed, shoeprint of the spacesuit does not match the footprint of the Moon. The astronauts, when asked if they had really gone to the Moon, did not swear before the Bible to tell the truth. There are videos of a spacecraft taking off from the Moon, who took it out. Videos with strange movements and falls against the supposed force of gravity 1/6 of that of the Earth. Rocks of the lunar background without curvature. They take cars to the Moon and play golf on Apollo XVII and 50 years later there is no technology to go. Physical theories involved\nLaw of universal gravitation Spherical**: Theory proposed by Isaac Newton to explain the behavior of celestial bodies. The 3-body problem is not stable and does not generate elliptical orbits. According to Newton himself, his theory needed divine adjustments from time to time to be fulfilled. The graviton is a hypothesized particle. The law of universal gravitation and Coulomb\u0026rsquo;s law (EM) have the same formula, changing the electron charge (q) by the charge of the electron (q).

The graviton is a hypothesized particle. The law of universal gravitation and Coulomb\u0026rsquo;s law (EM) have the same formula changing the charge of the electron (q) by the mass of the object (m). Flat: this law is applied for two bodies, The three-body problem was a very famous problem of the time and as a result of its study it has been found that it does not generate stable elliptical orbits. According to the official version applied to millions of masses since it would affect all bodies, and even in motion this calculus would be much more complicated. According to Isaac Newton himself: \u0026ldquo;This theory needs divine adjustment epontaneously to be fulfilled\u0026rdquo;, which implied a creator to be fulfilled and did not explain the motion of bodies completely. An invented law that does not explain the motion of the stars and needs multiple corrections. Newton was more of an occultist and alchemist than a physicist, he was later lauded by science, the Vatican and the English Jesuit movement. There is no empirical experiment that proves that masses are bound to each other at infinite distance. The graviton is a hypnotized particle, unlike the electron. The law of universal gravitation and Coulomb\u0026rsquo;s law (EM) have the same formula by changing the charge of the electron (q) by the mass of the object (m). With densities it is very easy to demonstrate the buoyancy of bodies, their falling and rising. General Relativity\nSpherical**: Theory proposed by Albert Einstein, the speed limit in the universe is light in vacuum. For this limit to be met, space-time is modified in the motion of matter and waves close to the speed of light (c), at low speeds Newtonian dynamics is applied. Flat**: convoluted to dwarf the human being, space-time becomes a two-dimensional dimension deformable by large masses and high velocities. It is called a theory but has not been demonstrated in any laboratory experiment. Coriolis effect\nSpherical**: Effect by which bodies in a rotating system are deflected in one direction. Flat: There is no such effect, snipers and engineers do not take it into account. The explanation for the rotation of cyclones in different directions is due to the current of the winds. Archimedes Principle: Archimedes Principle.\nSpherical**: It is fulfilled but does not explain the weights of bodies and in space there is no medium without vacuum. Flat**: Proposed by Archimedes in the 10th century BC. It explains why bodies rise or fall in the media as it depends on the density of the media. The buoyancy force is what makes bodies rise or fall. For example: a coin sinks in water, while a thin layer of ice floats. This is because the coin is denser than water, so it sinks (downward buoyancy) while a layer of ice floats because its density is less than that of water. Icebergs float only a small portion because their gemetrically distributed density is greater and most of the ice sinks. Vacuum or ether.\nSpherical: Michelson\u0026rsquo;s experiment. Planar: There is no vacuum, there is a medium. All the experiments that tried to prove the existence of a vacuum gave false results and were withdrawn because they did not prove a vacuum. This indicated that there must be a medium, through which light propagates, known as ether. According to the official model and the laws of thermodynamics it is impossible to sustain an atmosphere next to a pure vacuum because it would collapse the system under pressure. All the experiments made to try to demonstrate the vacuum and to remove the thought of the ether were false, that is to say, they demonstrated the existence of the ether. Center of the system\nSpherical: Heliocentrism, Sun at the center of the planetary system with planets revolving around it. Planar: Geocentrism, Earth at the center of the system, Sun and Moon revolve around it. System formation\nSpherical: Big Bang, expansion beyond the speed of light. By gravity the planets take their shape and orbit. An external creator from another higher dimension. Since it is a holographic reality. In history Historically.\nSpherical**: Lodges / Power groups: Jesuits, Freemasonry. Official model since the 16th century. Planar**: Egyptian, Mayan, Babylonian. The Maya developed an eclipse calendar that even NASA uses. Institutions.\nSpherical: Government agencies: NASA (USA), AJAX (Japan), Rocosmos (Russia), ESA (Europe), India (India), Space One (China), CSA (Canada). Plana: Independent disseminators and small research groups. ELV, NAOV, Óliver Ibañez, Barea brothers, Nur for all. Space agencies look after their own interests, they lie to subjugate the people and to justify economic resources. They manipulate cognitive processes with propaganda and methods such as: negative priming, predictive programming and use CGI (Computer Generated Interface) to create the spherical model. Scientists\nSpherical: Eratosthenes (it should not since the ancient Greeks defended a flat model). Jesuits: Nicolas Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, William Hell, George Lamètre. Freemasons: Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Carl Sagan. Plana: Aristotle, Plato, Nikola Tesla. Quotations in history.\nSpherical: Established in science since the 17th century. XVII (inculcated from school). Plana: Bible, Koran, Book of Enoch, Hebrew books, Sumerian texts, ancient texts. Simulations.\nSpherical: Many simulations of a spherical version in documentaries, video games, movies, media, books. Large institutions, universities and companies are involved. Flat: Fewer simulations of a flat version and all its points. The two most famous games are flat: Minecraft and Fortnite. Gleason map. Appearances. Appearances.\nSpherical: In advertisements, news, series, movies, textbooks, media, more strongly since the 15th century and especially in the 20th and 11th century. Plan: UN symbol, map of Gleason\u0026rsquo;s Map. Considerations.\nSpherical: A sphere is a finite object, with a known radius and size. Plane: A plane but whose boundaries are not known and there is no aerial photograph of the whole. The maximum depth is not known either, since the deepest excavations are 15 Km and the wave effects do not reach very deep. Etymology.\nSpherical: Sphere: (Greek) σφαῖρα-sphaira, \u0026ldquo;globe, ball\u0026rdquo;. Globe: global. plane: Plane: airplane, glider, planet, \u0026ldquo;plane\u0026rdquo;, earthly plane, sea as a plate. Horizon (horizontal): \u0026ldquo;definite boundary\u0026rdquo; from Ancient Greek ὁρίζων (horízōn, \u0026ldquo;definite boundary\u0026rdquo;). Dome: domotics, domain, dominate, \u0026ldquo;dome\u0026rdquo; (in English), \u0026ldquo;doom\u0026rdquo; (doom), in programming to isolate files is called \u0026ldquo;vault\u0026rdquo; (dome, dome). Problems of each model Spherical earth\nWhy if spherical the constructions of long bridges do not curve the water? There is no well-done scientific experiment to support this.\nWhy don\u0026rsquo;t the mechanical gyroscopes of transatlantic airplanes rotate their axis and stay fixed if it is a sphere, when they circle thousands of miles? Pilots recognize that the gyro is a mechanical device and the tilt should be sensed to correct the angle. In addition, airplanes have a slight upward nose tilt for lift and glide in the air.\nWhy does the law of universal gravitation apply, if the 3-body problem does not form stable orbits and Newton recognized that it was useless, saying that it needed divine corrections? By separating the planets far enough apart you will find points of gravitational stability.\nWhy helium (He) rises in the air, ice partially floats on water if gravity is interaction of masses attracting each other according to their value and distance? According to gravity it cannot be explained, according to hydrodynamics or thermodynamics it can, but then it contradicts the theory of gravity.\nWhy don\u0026rsquo;t we notice the rotation of the Earth in the air, the birds, rockets, fall in the same place? There is no explanation, if it were moving it should be noticeable and not due to an effect of air currents.\nWhy if the Earth rotates the flights do not accelerate or slow down according to the rotation of the Earth? There is no demonstration of why the acceleration of the spin is not noticed. It is explained with Foucalt\u0026rsquo;s pendulum.\nWhy in the south the magnetism is less than in the north, if the nucleus is in the center? There is no explanation.\nHow is an electromagnetic field with a core possible?\nFlat Earth\nWhat is the Moon?\nWhat are the planets we observe?\nHow was the Earth generated?\nWhen did life arise?\nHow is the electromagnetic field generated?\nHow do the Earth and the Moon orbit?\nHow deep is the Earth? Excavation is unknown max. 15 km Tail well (Russia), waves give no information about the bottom of the Earth.\nWhat is beyond Antarctica? Unknown, it is assumed that Antarctica is the edge of the Earth, it is not known what material or if it can be crossed.\nIs the sky a spherical dome, hemispherical dome or space? Most believe it is a hemispherical dome that rotates.\nAre the Sun and Moon inside or outside the dome? The consensus is that they are inside the dome.\nIs it a hologram artificially created by other higher beings? This question complicates the issue and its answer does not solve how it was created, but that it was created.\nDoes it connect with higher dimensions? Some say through the moon, through the astral world?\nIrrefutable arguments Both models defend things that exist but one tries to adapt the model to reality and others adapt reality to the model made which is more correct because otherwise you can prove anything as valid.\nThe magnetic field exists and points to a direction which we call north.\nMatter falls and rises according to its density with respect to the medium, they tend to an equilibrium of densities. Density depends on mass and volume (d=m/V) and also on thermodynamic factors such as pressure, temperature, solubility of the medium that influence the volume.\nThere is no experiment that demonstrates the curvature of the Earth, only images from government space agencies (mostly NASA) and not photographs, there is only one considered as such and it is from Apollo XVII in which a realistic model was taken with a registered patent.\nThere is no experiment that demonstrates the rotation of the Earth, the Foucalt pendulum is useless, nor the Michelson-Morley experiment.\nGeocentrism and Heliocentrism are models that visualize the same movements in spite of being different observers, it is possible to explain the movements of the stars in the sky from both models.\nNASA has inconsistencies in its videos on the ISS such as pulling of ropes of devices in weightlessness, pulling of clothes, falling in weightlessness, people passing with wires in the background, frozen images of people in the scene. The atmosphere was shown differently at the beginning, the clouds were static, there were no night images (assuming orbit at high velocities in which it dawns 6 times in 24 hours). There are no videos of the cabin interior at liftoff, no transition of the spacecraft from base to orbit but a video cut. The stars in the orbit are sometimes shown and sometimes not regardless of the light entering the camera with the aperture.\nSeparate videos show a flat horizon at over 33 kilometers.\nQuestions and doubts Why does the other model lie? Spherical, terraplaners are wrong because they make up conspiracy theories, they have no empirical data. Flat, the spherical model is told to change our idea of reality and dwarf us. So that we do not know where we live, to justify billions of money investments of space agencies and governments. To put fear in us and to control our souls even more. How do they lie? Spherical, terraplanists have no empirical data, so they create conspiracy theories. The spherical model is the true one because it is the official one backed by most scientists and no one has proven otherwise in any scientific journal.\nFlat. The space institutions falsify most of its content, they have been doing it since the beginning of the space race. And the power groups have been doing it for thousands of years with world control. Videos have been faked since the 1960s, with Hollywood production. First the videos of space were not very credible, the earth did not rotate, the clouds did not move, there were no areas of twilight or shadow, the stars could not be seen, there were no areas of night. And as time has gone by and technology has improved, these errors have been corrected, although there are some that continue to appear bubbles in space, pulling ropes tied to strong astronauts in weightlessness, ropes that are seen when doing somersaults. All the missions that have gone out of the Earth are false, the ISS does not exist, it is a model in a studio, that is why it always looks the same, nobody has gone to the Moon. False theories: the Big Bang, gravity. They have all the means, they can censor, they have intelligence agencies.\nCriticisms according to the other model According to those who defend the spherical model, the terraplanists do not have empirical data, nor are they scientists, so they create conspiracy theories. Their model has the majority of scientists, with videos recorded by space agencies and with theories exposed by renowned scientists. According to terraplanism the space institutions falsify most of their content, they have been practicing it since thousands of years ago with the world control of ideas and with the space theme since the 60\u0026rsquo;s falsifying the space videos with the rise of Hollywood. First the space videos were not very credible, the earth did not rotate, the clouds did not move, there were no areas of twilight or shadow, the stars could not be seen, there were no night areas. And as time has gone by and technology has improved, these errors have been corrected, although there are some that still remain, such as bubbles in space, strong pulls of ropes tied to the astronauts in supposed weightlessness, ropes that are seen when doing somersaults. All the missions that have left the Earth are false, the ISS does not exist, it is a mock-up in a studio, that is why it always looks the same, nobody has gone to the Moon. False theories: the Big Bang, gravity. They have all the means, they can censor, they have Intelligence agencies. Other proposed ways Hollow Earth: the interior of the earth is hollow, the maximum depth is 12 km. According to the spherical model the interior of the earth is the volume that houses the Earth sphere, inside would be divided into layers and iron core that creates the magnetic field. According to the flat model the depth of the planet is not known. Concave Earth**: the Earth is enclosed in a concave sphere with the sky inside and all the elements that make it up (Sun, Moon, stars ..). Double toroid**: the earth is a double toroid (JAH, Valdeande Magico). Icosahedron**: is the shape described by some for the planet seen from the outside. Representation of each model Spherical convex Earth Official model in force in 2021, Wikipedia version. Figure 1 : Spherical Earth from the outside, according to NASA.\nSpherical convex hollow Earth Hollow spherical convex Earth. The hollow Earth does not describe its external shape but its internal one. It postulates that there are large cavities in the interior of the Earth and that the Earth is mostly hollow. Flat Earth The flat model considers the spherical earth to be a simulation and not a real picture. Note : The flat Earth cannot be photographed from above because it cannot be exited. The maximum altitude raised does not exceed 300 km according to this model, and is therefore a representation. Finally, the one with the most negative primacy**, is the flat Earth. There are hundreds of times where in the media a flat earth is shown or real facts are shown. By means of negative priming or other cognitive methods, a repulsive effect is achieved in situations where the truth is exposed. Figure 2: Gleason map representing land surface and water level.\nToroidal earth Model atom side chains with vortices forming toroids, double toroids. Valdeande magic double toroid Earth\nConcave earth The sky and stars are a ball in the center, the ground is the inner edge of the concave sphere. Figure 3 : Concave Earth\nAspects to take into account The children As a fact, children who have not been educated in schools think that the Earth is flat, stationary and that the Sun revolves around it. However, the education model teaches them a contrary model considering their thinking as wrong and imposing a totally different model.\nFear of being wrong To doubt, to distrust, to think that we are wrong and that we have been deceived is hard. We have been educated all our lives in one way so you have to fight against your ego, against all your teachings to come up with an alternative opinion. A minority doubts and the majority that hears something out of line gets angry or laughs about it. It is more comfortable to think that you are right and that the power groups and scientific institutions do not deceive us.\nScientific method Neither model considers that it leaves aside science, both operate by telling the truth. However the two are not compatible and one of the two lies or tells the truth. However, the one who lies does not imply that everything he says is wrong and the one who tells the truth does not imply that everything is true. To demonstrate the shape of the planet, the scientific method must be used, but it must be well used, it must be empirical, there must be debate, it must operate for the good and it must not be used for the sake of the good, and it must not be used for the sake of the good. To demonstrate the shape of the planet, the scientific method must be used, but it must be well used, it must be empirical, there must be debate, it must operate for the Good and the knowledge must not be hidden. But science should not only focus on the rational, it must also take into account the soul aspect.\nThe process of changing established ideas / awakening is hard**. Letting go of all your preconceived ideas about a subject is very complicated, just the fact of doubting and asking yourself if it is correct is very hard. Getting out of your comfort zone and wondering if you might have been fooled is very shocking. But if you are a scientist or want to learn how the nature of reality works, you have to put aside your preconceived ideas and keep an open mind for any change that with enough arguments will shake the established theory. If after having carefully reviewed, listened to other opinions and researched the subject, you come to the conclusion that certain things were not true. Then you will be using a good method to understand reality, which is what science should pursue, not to impose pre-established ideas but to promote research and debate in whatever field. However, the flat model explains less behavior and leaves more uncertainty in some aspects such as the depth of the Earth, the length of the land beyond Antarctica, the maximum height that can be reached. A flat earth is not suistiutr only the shape of the earth, it implies changing the conceived model of what we have been told of the universe as a whole. The Earth in the center of the system, with the Sun and Moon rotating, following an orbit in the form of infinity; constellations, planets revolving around in a celestial vault. There is no vacuum on the outside, since it is thermodynamically impossible to sustain an atmosphere next to a pure vacuum. It is not known the shape below max excavation 12 km, nor in extension to the sides nobody has crossed the ice mirrors of Antarctica.\nPredictive programming / negative priming Finally the one with the most negative primacy is the flat Earth. There are hundreds of times where in the media a flat earth is shown or real facts are shown. By means of negative priming or other cognitive methods, a repulsive effect is achieved in situations where the truth is exposed.\n**Negative priming is the slowing down in the classification or identification of previously presented stimuli in comparison with other similar stimuli that have not been presented. It consists of telling the truth between dramatic or comedic arguments to generate in your implicit memory a feeling of rejection towards the true information when it is explained to you.\nFinal reflection Personal opinion I have always liked to investigate, to know and to learn. I want to investigate from science and expose the results to tell the truth whatever it is, because the truth should not be hidden, should not be censored and we can all be wrong we just have to help each other and correct mistakes. What is not right is that they want to lie shamelessly to us whoever they are to justify their actions and say that they act for the good of humanity. The main problem is that we do not have enough time to consider what we have studied during school, university. And we are usually comfortable, trusting and do not think that we can be lied to at that level.\nThe thing is that no matter if you are a physicist, you can fall into the trap because you do not consider that it could be false, you assume it as a proven fact of the past. It is true that you cannot be suspicious of everything, because otherwise it would be a misery, but think that there are groups that operate for world control without looking after your interests. This does not imply that all the physics that is taught is false, but yes, if a fundamental law is not correct all the theories that are intertwined would need a correction. It seems that anyone who goes against what is established is a conspiracy theorist and wants to deceive when perhaps it is the other way around.\nLast but not least we should not categorize ourselves into two groups, we should operate by what is verifiable, empirical, by the truth whatever it is. The elites want to categorize us, they do it in all the propaganda they sell, but we must respect each other as it is a matter that concerns us all and fight together leaving aside ideals, race, religion. We all come from the same source so we are all one.\nConclusion There is the idea that the way you perceive reality depends on the frequency dimension in which you find yourself. And the issue that the receiver conditions the message, so according to this statement science could have a result that is conditioned by the subject. Or even more so, the subject could be suggestible and make him see reality in a different way, just by the fact of changing his thoughts since\n","permalink":"https://curiosity432.xyz/posts/earth-models/","summary":"Sphere vs. plane In this article we will present in an organized way all types of arguments between the models proposed to describe the shape of the Earth, the spherical model and the flat circular model, in order to compare and try to find the model that best fits reality. From now on it will be cited as spherical or flat as appropriate.\nBrief description (shape, rotation, sky) Spherical: official version from the 15th to the 15th century.","title":"Earth models comparison"},{"content":"Official version In 2021 for the official science the Earth is a sphere that rotates and moves along with the Moon (only satellite) and with more planets all orbiting around the Sun forming the solar system. In addition this system rotates around a larger system within the Milky Way galaxy, which is located within a supercluster of galaxies, within an observable universe in constant accelerated expansion. This system is formed by the planets listed by their proximity to the Sun as: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.\nAll this in a universe in accelerated expansion in which the galaxies are moving away from each other and this expansion occurs on a larger scale as you move away from the center, due to a big explosion called Big Bang. The planets and galaxies are grouped together due to the gravity that acts between masses with action to infinity so that their attraction decays according to the distance, also the version of relativity is that the large masses and speeds close to light deform the fourth physical dimension of space-time. And that the universe is made up of dark energy (74 %), dark matter (22 %) and (4 %) galactic interaction of gas, stars, matter, etc.\nThis phenomenon over millions of years originated by chance all that we know today. By means of the explosion of a pea, the whole vast universe was originated, and matter was created and ordered according to the gravitational action. The creation of life through the evolution of very simple living beings to more advanced living beings with intellectual capacity and consciousness.\nFrom the Earth, the Moon, the only natural satellite with the same apparent size as the Sun in the sky, has an asynchronous rotation movement with the Earth, that is to say, it always shows the same face because it rotates and moves at the same speed. And we can see it thanks to the fact that it is illuminated by the Sun that is on the non-visible face of the planet Earth, on the illuminated face, making it grow or decrease in size based on the shadow cast by the Earth on the Moon.\nThe different seasons within the Earth are due to the tilt of the planet 23.4º on the plane of the ecliptic that makes the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays change their inclination, rotating at a speed of 1670 mph.\nThe Moon rotates at a speed of 1670 km / h on itself and 107 200 km / h around the Sun traveling an elliptical orbit around the Sun with its farthest point at 152 098 232 km away. In turn, the Moon rotates and moves through the Earth at a distance of 363 300 km, rotating and moving at the same speed with a period of 27 days (asynchronous rotation), 7 hours and 43.7 minutes. With a radius of 1737 km.\nThe radii are:\nSun: 695508 Km Earth: 6371 Km Moon: 1737 Km Recreation of the motion of the Solar System as a whole: The channel ToScale: made a video recreating the solar system to scale (heliocentric model) with the Sun the size of a 1.5 meter ball and the Earth a bowling pin like a fingernail. To scale the Earth was arranged at 176 meters, Mars at 269 meters and so on with the rest of the planets. Between the Earth and the Sun fit 1 294 037 planets Earth.\nHistory and change of conception All ancient civilizations Ancient Egyptians, Mayans, Babylonians, Hebrews, Berbers, Ancient Greeks considered the Earth to be a stationary plane in which the Sun, Moon, stars and wandering bodies revolved around the Earth, the Earth being the center of the system.\nWith the Sun and Moon in perfect duality and equal size in the sky. They took into account the effects of the stars on human beings and society with the study of astrology, which was linked to astronomy. They built great monuments geographically located in stratagic positions that still point to the same constellations and stars in the winter and summer solstices. And with a very high knowledge of mathematics, astronomy, physics to be carried out. Nowadays the pyramids of Egypt, Giza, Stonehenge are difficult constructions to build because of the great weight of the rocks. They are also very strong energetic centers.\nIn 1520, Nicolás Copernico, who belonged to the Jesuit order, with the support of the church, took the Earth out of the center and placed the Sun with all the planets revolving around it. Although it is said that he had the Catholic Church against him, it was not so. Later scientists such as Galileo Galilei did not suffer attacks from the Church, only a friend of the Pope who did not cause him any harm, all his studies were supported by the Vatican. And after several centuries this idea took hold and became official, astronomy was separated from astrology and the Jesuits regained control of the church that they had lost for some time. For this reason, scientists took their efforts to adapt the equations and explain the phenomena of the heavens for a spherical Earth, so the model was built by Nicolás Copernico, Galileo Galieo, William Hell, Isaac Newton, George Lametre, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkings.\nThe official model does not fit reality. There is no simulation that reliably represents the rotations, translations, inclinations, movements of all the planets with their orbits using Newton\u0026rsquo;s gravity equations or those of general relativity, since gravity according to relativity is not considered a force but an interaction in matter modifying space-time.\nRight now astronomy only tries to adapt the created historical model of a sphere, with historically manipulated data and space agencies that distribute false images made with CGI. But it does not consider analyzing the basic nature without the need to adapt something already existing, which could imply promoting a farce.\nHowever if you live in a spherical model as described above you should notice and perceive the described effects of a giant rotating ball. If you live in a spherical model with radius 6371 km you have to assume that the surface of the continents and oceans are curved, in addition to rotation, translation and everything described above. It is also implied that your size in the universe is negligible, your creation a product of chance and evolution, and your space you occupy in the universe is not in doubt because it already has an \u0026ldquo;answer\u0026rdquo;.\nWell, wherever you look independently without using external images (from space agencies or the media), that is to say all your own facts verifiable from Earth. You as a person with your senses or with measuring instruments will not find evidence of the existence of curvature on the Earth for the model described with the radius of 6371 km. And why there is no curvature? Because the verifiable facts prove it.\nThere are two ways to establish a model: to analyze nature and to obtain the result of experimentation or to deny a scientifically based assertion. Since we start from the premise that in reality two opposing truths cannot coexist, if subjectively in the minds of people but not in the objective reality theoretically independent of the observer, because otherwise it becomes more metaphysical and more conditioned by thought.\nWell, let\u0026rsquo;s try to demonstrate the curvature of the Earth, which implies that the objects are hidden at a greater distance by the fall of the curvature itself. To do the calculation if you do not trust you can do it yourself by (the Pythagorean theorem, basic trigonometry, spherical trigonometry or with the change of curvature per unit for a perimeter of a circle), I did it too but I do not put it because otherwise it is very long. The website Earthcurvature.com with the formulas (code on GitHub) and allows to calculate the height per angle of fall. You enter the distance data from your point of view to the observed place and as a result you get the depth or height that an object is hidden on the ball Earth. Here I leave a table with the distances and their corresponding height that is hidden:\nAccording to the theory of the spherical Earth in the ocean should be curved waters, for an observer from sea level objects at 5 km distance with calm sea would be hidden 1.96 masl (meters above sea level) and more if we increase the distance.\nHowever in practice this does not happen, from sea level we can observe the objects completely (from the base in the sea) for more than 30 kilometers, the maximum distance will depend on the visibility and our vision system (eye, camera, binoculars, telescope). Objects disappear on the horizon due to environmental visibility, perspective and optics (refraction of the medium and reflection). However, if the objects were seen by a refraction phenomenon, all the objects would have to be placed longitudinally at the correct height of the horizon without being cut off to be seen completely, and this has not been demonstrated to be true for the entire curvature of the horizon.\nHowever in practice this does not happen, from sea level we can observe the objects completely (from the base in the sea) for more than 30 kilometers, the maximum distance will depend on the visibility and our vision system (eye, camera, binoculars, telescope). Objects disappear on the horizon due to environmental visibility, perspective and optics (refraction of the medium and reflection). However, if the objects were seen by a refraction phenomenon, all the objects would have to be placed longitudinally at the correct height of the horizon without being cut to be seen completely, and this has not been demonstrated and it is impossible that it is fulfilled in all the stretch of curvature from the observer to the object. Moreover, the Fata Morgana effect, a mirage in which the objects are superimposed inverted in a long way by a high thermal gradient, can only be demonstrated in the laboratory on a flat water surface.\nThe next argument is fluid dynamics, liquid water macroscopically without intervention of forces (external or internal) does not bend in a state of repose, and this is easily demonstrable and testable. Water levels water always levels in a plane, curved water at rest goes against hydrodynamics and fluid mechanics. Liquids but in particular water by its properties, is the greatest instrument for leveling a surface, that is, it remains flat to the surface independent of the shape of the container.\nThe way they have to explain it is with gravity but we are back to the same thing because helium rises, hot air rises and cold air falls in the atmosphere, ice floats on water. That is a fact but the way of explaining it may differ. What is observed is that bodies tend to equilibrium of densities within the medium. Everything in nature tends to equilibrium, it is a universal principle that energy tends towards thermodynamic or energetic equilibrium.\nYou must also assume if you defend the model that the Earth is in the purest absolute vacuum, through which light (photons) travels and at a temperature close to absolute zero (0 Kelvin), without any pressure, with zero gravity. None of these things is verifiable, the Michelson-Morley experiment was the one that disproved the existence of the medium ether that was believed to be outside the planet, but it requires relativity that has not been proven and is maintained as a hypothesis.\nThe spherical Earth with its atmosphere is in contact with the absolute vacuum of outer space, thermodynamically impossible for vacuum and pressure to coexist since the air of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere would expand.\nAll planets, systems and galaxies are floating and are bound together by the action of gravity, in a constant fall in the vacuum that keeps them \u0026lsquo;floating\u0026rsquo;. The theory of universal gravitation is not able to demonstrate orbits for more than two bodies, the famous three-body problem that its result does not form stable orbits, imagine for millions of interacting bodies in an expanding universe. Boom!\nSo that it would be spherical and the calculations would have to be a much larger globe earth than stipulated, but if these data were altered to make it larger it would not fit with other statements of the solar system, the gravitational adjustments would vary and the masses of other planets would have to be corrected. The rotation speed would be different and that is why they cannot adjust the radii and velocities because they would have to change the rest. What they can change are the new distances or new data taken.\nThe independent videos (without manipulation and without fisheye lens camera) show a flat circular horizon in 360º. In this video that reaches up to 37 Km of latura is clearly observed an extension of flat land with a circular flat horizon, that is to say that at that height according to the ball earth would be more than visible.\nAs a curious fact the stars from 60 km altitude disappear and this is verifiable by observations of hot air balloons, so imagine the scam of satellites that photographed the galaxies, Hubble is an airplane with an integrated telescope and not a satellite orbiting.\nThe problem lies in\u0026hellip; The problem is to put the focus on a model and try to prove it at all costs, and if there is something that does not match, the previous data is modified to fit it or it is considered an exception, chance, randomness or it is not taken into account. And that is not valid to demonstrate a model, it is an erronous method and it is not scientific to adjust numbers to fit with reality.\nFirst is to perceive reality and then create the model, not the other way around, it is a subjective method (of the subject) that tries to seek objectivity (of the object) because first you have to assume based on experimentation and observation and then check.\nThe model may have mathematical data that fit but that does not mean that it is reality. If three basic arguments are not provable it should already be considered wrong and checked again, however it seems that \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; science is not willing to give up.\nThen why do we continue to believe in something that cannot be demonstrated, for several points of view and very linked to the mind, specifically to the subconscious. Since childhood (at least since the twentieth century) we have all been educated with a model, rules, guidelines that tell us what is right and what is wrong as an argument of authority, whether parents, teachers, politicians, scientists and the media. Starting from this, the formation of our childhood defines our future, so if you promote an idea to people from childhood you will condition them regardless of whether it is good or bad. Now the media do the same, they use sophisticated manipulation techniques such as conditioning or predictive programming to predict your behavior, making use of the effect of mere exposure, latent inhibition, subliminal advertising and create a social pressure on the individual. How many times does a spherical earth appear in the media in a day? Well, the answer would be that it depends on the media you consume, but in the mass media it is repeated a lot, it appears in the news, programs, advertisements, movies, series, video games, textbooks, logos, etc. In case you forget the form, they are already there to repeat it. If something is true there is no need to repeat it because it is known, if it is repeated a lot or advertised a lot doubt its credibility because they will have some reason to promote it so much.\nThe trap experiments To be able to carry out a model you need experimentation and the ephemeral model boasts of it but its validity is equal to zero, and it is not conclusive. List of experiments to try to prove the spherical earth with all its argumentation:\nCavendish experiment. To demonstrate gravity and measure the density of the Earth. They do not demonstrate that masses attract each other, it only works with two masses and claims to measure the density of a supposed ball of 6731 km radius. To explain gravity there is no consensus on how it is generated who produces it, it is explained that objects attract each other according to the mass of the bodies. But we have already seen with examples that this is not true and that it depends on the density. Foucault\u0026rsquo;s pendulum. To demonstrate the rotation of the Earth. It is not useful because pendulums are not stable in their motion, they do not give information about the motion of the Earth. Also in solar eclipses its movement is completely straight. Experiment of Heratosthenes. To demonstrate the sphericity of the planet Earth. It considers the parallel rays instead of radial. That is why in the model they have to move the Sun millions of kilometers away instead of placing them much closer. Michelson-Morley experiment. To demonstrate that space is empty and there is no medium (the ether), all experiments failed and demonstrated the absence of vacuum, finally by the creation of relativity and the modification of space-time it was explainable. The problem lies in setting the objective of demonstrating the vacuum by conditioning a result and discarding all those that said the contrary and the invention of a theory that is completely theoretical. Cosmic microwave background. To demonstrate the Big Bang, he uses a photo with electromagnetic radiation taken by an ESA satellite and thus explains the whole process of the Big Bang.

I\u0026rsquo;ll explain it below.\nCuriosity Curiosity\u0026rsquo;_ (curiosity in English), is that fact that drives us all to learn, to want to know more, it is the engine of knowledge and the advancement of society. It is that natural stimulus that incites us to investigate, to try to understand the basic questions of philosophy, which are those that science tries to answer with arguments and demonstrations.\nWithout curiosity there would be no learning and this would be boring, tiresome and tiresome, it would basically become an obligation and not a fact chosen by us with freedom of decision.\nCuriosity is the desire to learn and explore the unknown, it is the need to satisfy your mind or body in order to experiment or feel, to better understand the nature of reality.\n432 Meaning The number 432 is not just a number with three digits followed in descending order one by one. It stands out for being considered an angelic number as a divine message and at a frequential level it has a lot of importance.\nPhysically it is true that at the frequency of 432 Hz in water molecules vibrate forming a very stable three-dimensional geometric structure, maintaining a symmetry and harmony in its pulse. Water is a very important substance, it is essential for life and is abundantly present in all carbon systems, i.e. in living beings and organic matter. The human being is composed of more than 60% water, which is a resonant frequency with humans. These vibrations reach their highest geometric stability at 432 Hz and in their consecutive tones.\nIn the past, instrument tunings used as reference note different values such as 415 Hz, 427-430 Hz, 435 Hz (most used), 466 Hz. However, finally in 1953 the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) finally assigned 440 Hz as the standard, some say promoted by the Nazi government of Germany. The characteristic of 440 Hz is that the notes in this tuning sound louder and there are fewer harmonics between them due to their lower resonance. While at 432 Hz, unlike the previous one, the tones are mostly whole cycles (without decimal part, e.g.: 222.73 Hz) and their related tones are much more geometrically stable sounds in an aqueous medium and consequently in living beings. It should be noted that the reference note to establish the tuning of the instruments is the $La_4$ of the piano, $A_4$ in English notation.\nIn the case of the name C432 (abbreviated Curiosity432) symbolizes C (Do) at 432 Hz, i.e. a tuning with reference note C4 A4.\nVideo of water vibrating at 432 Hz generated by a bass synthesizer.

And that is the purpose of this blog, to share that information that brings value and makes each of us grow introspectively as a Being through knowledge.\nDefinitions Hertz (Hz): cycles per second, i.e. the number of revolutions or repetitions per second of the pulse. Second (s): comes from dividing the time it takes for the Sun to rise again from its position in the sky (one day), in two strips of 12 for the duality (day-night) and the meaning of twelve, making a total of 24 hours. The hours in turn are divided into bands of 60 minutes for each hour and 60 seconds for each minute. To establish a more precise definition of time, atomic clock oscillations are currently used, but its historical origin is attributed to Ancient Egypt. Logo The Curiosity432 logo is a combination of a dark blue sphere with twelve white dots above and twelve red dots below, a light blue ellipse in the middle, an orange circle vibrating at a frequency, an outline around the vibrating circle forming a C, the letters uriosity and the numbers 432.\nEach of these geometric figures has a meaning of its own:\nThe dark blue sphere with the twenty-four points evenly distributed above and below represents heaven with the stars above and inferno with the magma below. It could be considered that there is no distinction between one and the other since as the phrase says as above so below. The central ellipse in lighter blue represents water, specifically water at level. The orange circle is a vibrating body representing the Sun, the vibration pattern corresponds to the typical one seen with harmonic frequencies on the surface of a fluid. The blue outline of the orange circle refers to the C of Curiosity but can also be seen as part of the outline of the field generated by the Sun (body in constant vibration). The numbers 432, refer to the above mentioned the most stable frequency of vibration of water. This simple logo is intended to show a cosmological vision of our world and to express in a deep and powerful way the meaning of the channel.\n","permalink":"https://curiosity432.xyz/posts/curiosity432-meaning/","summary":"Name Curiosity432 is not a random name, it comes from the combination of Curiosity + 432, however it has a why and a much deeper meaning behind it. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain it below.\nCuriosity Curiosity\u0026rsquo;_ (curiosity in English), is that fact that drives us all to learn, to want to know more, it is the engine of knowledge and the advancement of society. It is that natural stimulus that incites us to investigate, to try to understand the basic questions of philosophy, which are those that science tries to answer with arguments and demonstrations.","title":"Curiosity432 meaning"},{"content":" To answer the question \u0026laquo;What is a numeral system?\u0026raquo; also called system of numeration or base X (where X is a number) we will start with its definition. A numbering system is a set of symbols and generation rules that allow us to construct all valid numbers.\nMathematically it is expressed as: $$N = (S, R)$$ where:\nN: is the numbering system under consideration. S: is the set of symbols allowed in the system. R: are the rules that tell us which numbers and which operations are valid in the system. They are classified into two main groups: positional and non-positional:\nIn positional systems the value of a digit depends both on the symbol used, and on the position that symbol occupies in the number. This is the case of Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII\u0026hellip;). In non-positional systems the digits have the value of the symbol used, which does not depend on the position (column) they occupy in the number. For example, modern Arabic numerals. Note: both Arabic and Roman numerals are decimal system numbers (base ten).\nThe numbering systems are the basis for counting things, the material or in general the quantitative. However to count it is not necessary to make use of numbers, animals can count, a shepherd dog knows if there are sheep missing in his flock or not and he does it using his vision. The basic way to count is by using the senses (sight, touch, hearing, taste or smell) interacting with objects, shapes, colors or smells. While at a more complex level would be to make use of mathematical calculation, using the numbering systems with their rules and corresponding numbers.\nAnd what does a number mean or represent? Well, there are two ways of defining it:\nIn abstract form, it is the fundamental element of number system (set provided with two operations that verify certain conditions related to the commutative, associative and distributive properties). Of concrete form, it represents a metric quantity or an ordinal number that occupies a position within an order of a given series. Graphically the number is written by means of symbols defined by the numbering system, these symbols or graphemes are called digits, and if they are formed by a single character is called digit. For example 2048 is a digit of the Arabic numeral system, and its digits are two (2), zero (0), four (4), and eight (8). The numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are digits since they consist of a single digit.\nThroughout history most civilizations have used the base ten system, however some civilizations such as the Mayans or the Aztecs used a vigesimal system (base twenty).\n\u0026ldquo;Nowadays, the Arabic system is the most widely used to represent numbers. They are called \u0026ldquo;Arabic\u0026rdquo; because the Hispano-Arabs of al-Andalus introduced them in Europe through their cultural action, although their invention originated in India. The world owes to Indian culture the momentous invention of the positional numbering system, as well as the discovery of 0 (zero), called śūnya (shuunia) or bindu in Sanskrit language, however the Maya also knew both 0 and positional numbering.\u0026rdquo; [[#Wikipedia bibliography | Citation 4]]\nInstead there are many more systems in use than we might expect, there is binary (in computing), ternary (logical comparison and ternary computers), quaternary (in quantum computing), octal (computing), hexadecimal (in computers). The minutes and seconds that are repeated every 60 or the hours every 12, do not form a numbering system of their own since they make use of the decimal system. This is the application of modular arithmetic, in this case modulo 60 and modulo 12.\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Numeration states the general formula for constructing a number N, with a finite number of decimal places in a positional numbering system of base b, such that:\nwhere:\nN : valid number in the numbering system. b : base of the numbering system, number of symbols allowed in the system. d: digit, any symbol allowed in the numbering system. n: number of digits of the integer part, including zero (0). k: number of digits of the decimal part. Posición … 2 1 0 -1 -2 … Valor base … b² b¹ b⁰ $$b^{-1}$$ $$b^{-2}$$ … Dígito … d² d¹ d⁰ $$d^{-2}$$ $$d^{-2}$$ … Ej: decimal base … 100 10 1 0.1 0.01 … In conclusion, mathematics is not invented, it is discovered as a method to express abstractly the changes in nature; what is invented is the method of expressing it, but not the content.\nBibliography of Wikipedia Modular arithmetic Numerical digit Number Arabic numerals Numeral system ","permalink":"https://curiosity432.xyz/posts/system-num/","summary":"To answer the question \u0026laquo;What is a numeral system?\u0026raquo; also called system of numeration or base X (where X is a number) we will start with its definition.
